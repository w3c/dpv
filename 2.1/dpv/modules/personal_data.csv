AnonymisedData,class,https://w3id.org/dpv#AnonymisedData,Anonymised Data,Personal Data that has been (fully and completely) anonymised so that it is no longer considered Personal Data,,https://w3id.org/dpv#NonPersonalData,https://w3id.org/dpv#NonPersonalData,"It is advised to carefully consider indicating data is fully or completely anonymised by determining whether the data by itself or in combination with other data can identify a person. Failing this condition, the data should be denoted as PseudonymisedData. To indicate data is anonymised only for a specified entity (e.g. within an organisation), the concept ContextuallyAnonymisedData (as subclass of PseudonymisedData) should be used instead of AnonymisedData.",2022-01-19,,dpv,https://w3id.org/dpv
