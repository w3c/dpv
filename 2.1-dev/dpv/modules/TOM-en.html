    <h2>DPV and Related Resources</h2>
    <p>[[[DPV]]]: is the base/core specification for the 'Data Privacy Vocabulary', which is extended for Personal Data [[PD]], Locations [[LOC]], Risk Management [[RISK]], Technology [[TECH]], and [[AI]]. Specific [[LEGAL]] extensions are also provided which model jurisdiction specific regulations and concepts - see the <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv/legal#dpv-extensions">complete list of extensions</a>. To support understanding and applications of [[DPV]], various guides and resources [[GUIDES]] are provided, including a [[PRIMER]]. A <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv/2.0/search">Search Index</a> of all concepts from DPV and extensions is available.</p>
    <p>[[DPV]] and related resources are published on <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/releases">GitHub</a>. For a general overview of the Data Protection Vocabularies and Controls Community Group [[DPVCG]], its history, deliverables, and activities - refer to <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/dpvcg/"><u>DPVCG Website</u></a>.

  </figure>
  <p>DPV's taxonomy of tech/org measures are structured into four groups representing [=TechnicalMeasure=] such as encryption or deidentification which operate at a technical level, [=OrganisationalMeasure=] such as policies and training which operate at an organisational level, [=LegalMeasure=] which are organisational measures with legal enforcement such as contracts and NDAs, and [=PhysicalMeasure=] which are associated with physical aspects such as environmental protection and physical security. Each of these is provided with a taxonomy that expands upon the core idea to provide a rich list of measures that are intended to protect personal data and technologies (and its associated entities and consequences).</p>
  <p>To indicate applicability of measures, the relations [=hasTechnicalMeasure=], [=hasOrganisationalMeasure=], [=hasLegalMeasure=], and [=hasPhysicalMeasure=] are provided. In addition to these, specific relations are also provided for concepts commonly used or which are important for legal considerations - such as [=hasNotice=] and [=hasPolicy=].</p>

  </figure>
    <p>Technical measures refer to measures that are implemented at a technical level. They are represented by the concept [=TechnicalMeasure=] and are indicated using the relation [=hasTechnicalMeasure=]. Concepts provided to represent commonly used technical measures include [=AccessControlMethod=], [=AuthenticationProtocols=], [=AuthorisationProtocols=], [=CryptographicMethods=], [=DataBackupProtocols=], [=DigitalRightsManagement=], [=Encryption=], and  [=SecurityMethod=].</p>
    <p>To express information about the technology implementing the technical measure, the concept `Technology` can be associated by using the relation `isImplementedUsingTechnology`. The [[TECH]] extension provides further concepts to represent technologies and their development and provision.</p>

      <h3>Assessments</h3>
      <p>[=Assessment=] refers to a document, plan, or process for assessment or determination towards a purpose. For example, legal compliance assessment establishes compliance with the law and lawfulness. Similarly, privacy assessments concern privacy, risk assessments concern risks, and impact assessments concern impacts of operations and technologies. To represent such commonly utilised assessments, DPV provides the following concepts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>[=ComplianceAssessment=] and its extended concept [=LegalComplianceAssessment=] for compliance and legal compliance related assessments e.g. with a particular law</li>
        <li>[=ConformanceAssessment=] for assessment of conformance e.g. towards a standard or guideline</li>
        <li>[=DataInteroperabilityAssessment=] to assess the interoperability of data, such as that required by regulations like [[DGA]]</li>
        <li>[=DataQualityAssessment=] for assessment of data quality</li>
        <li>[=EffectivenessDeterminationProcedures=] for assessment of the effectiveness of other measures or activities</li>
        <li>[=LegitimateInterestAssessment=] to assess the legitimate interests used (as a legal basis) to justify the activity </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Assessments which refer to risks and/or impacts, such as risk assessment, privacy impact assessment, data protection impact assessment, and data breach impact assessment are defined in the 'risk' module within DPV due to their role within the risk management processes.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Notices</h3>
      <p>[=Notice=] represents notification of information i.e. providing information about something to an entity. Notices are commonly used to communicate in situations such as providing information about privacy practices ([=PrivacyNotice=]), requests for informed consent ([=ConsentNotice=]), informing about security incidents ([=SecurityIncidentNotice=]) such as data breaches ([=DataBreachNotice=]), or to describe the transfer of data ([=DataTransferNotice=]). Notices are associated by using the relation [=hasNotice=].</p>
      <p>Notices may contain only information, or also have interactive components intended to make decisions, offer choices and controls, or otherwise carry out processes that go beyond mere provision of information. </p>
        <aside class="example" title="Privacy Notice used in an activity">

        <h4>Consent Notice</h4>
        <p>Requirements for <i>informed</i> consent require provision of information before the consent is obtained so as to inform the individual. This information is typically provided through a <i>notice</i>, which can be specified using the concept <code>ConsentNotice</code> and the relation <code>hasNotice</code>. As with the previous notice example, a consent notice can be a link to the actual notice document or web-page, or contain description of the notice contents regarding processing of personal data.</p>

      <p>[=Policy=] represents a guidance document outlining procedures, plans, principles, decisions, intent, or protocols. It is associated using the relation [=hasPolicy=]. DPV provides concepts to represent policies regarding:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>[=DataProcessingPolicy=] for specifying how data processing takes place - including [=DataDeletionPolicy=], [=DataErasurePolicy=], [=DataRestorationPolicy=], and [=DataStoragePolicy=].</li>
        <li>In addition to the above data related policies, DPV also defines [=DataJurisdictionPolicy=] to specify jurisdictional requirements, and [=DataReusePolicy=] for specifying how data can be further used for purposes other than its initial purpose.</li>
        <li>[=InformationSecurityPolicy=] regarding information security</li>
        <li>[=LoggingPolicy=] regarding logging of information (i.e. maintaining logs and records as a technical concept).</li>
        <li>[=MonitoringPolicy=] for how something should be monitored e.g. other policies and activities.</li>
        <li>[=RecertificationPolicy=] for how often or when certification should be renewed or checked for conformance.</li>
      <div class="note" title="Privacy Policy vs Privacy Notice">
        <p>DPV does not provide the concept <i>PrivacyPolicy</i>, but instead suggests to use the better expressed and less ambiguous term - <code>PrivacyNotice</code>. This is to explicitly denote that the role of what is considered common as a "privacy policy" is actually a "notice" intended for end users and other individuals, instead of being an internal policy document for how the company should approach 'privacy'. More information about notices is provided in the next section.</p>

        <aside class="example" title="Specifying compliance status and lawfulness">
<p>This example shows the compliance status associated with activities in terms of the organisation&#39;s policies and for the EU GDPR obligations. It shows how compliance issues and lawfulness can be documented as a status associated with a process. For GDPR, it uses the concepts from EU-GDPR extension regarding lawfulness.    <div class="source" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre class='nohighlight'style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">ex</span>:<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">PDH1</span> <span style="color: #B00040">a</span> <span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">dpv</span>:<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">Process</span> ;

      <h3>Record Keeping</h3>
      <p>Records, or storing of information with the intention to use it in the future, are an important obligation for several legal as well as other obligations related to data protection and privacy. To support record keeping, the concept [=RecordsOfActivities=] is provided. Specific records are represented with the concepts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>[=DataBreachRecord=] for data breach records</li>
        <li>[=DataProcessingRecord=] for records about data processing activities, including [=ConsentRecord=], [=DataTransferRecord=], [=SecurityIncidentRecord=], and [=ROPA=] (Records of Processing Activities) - which is a specific document required by regulations such as GDPR.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="note" title="Records as documentation vs Records as processing operation">
        <p>DPV also contains the <code>Record</code> concept as a type of Processing operation, and <code>RecordManagement</code> as a type of Purpose. The former refers to recording of personal data as a means to obtain it (e.g. record a conversation), while the latter relates to the use of personal data towards creating records and managing them as a purpose (e.g. record consent was given). These are distinct, though relevant to the organisational measures related to record keeping.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Record keeping may require further vocabularies to represent details such as various temporal annotations, provenance, statuses, or other contextual information that is not possible or provided for by DPV's concepts. In such cases, we suggest utilising other standardised vocabularies where applicable.</p>
      
      <aside class="note" title="Guide on implementing Consent Records using DPV">
        <p>See the [[[GUIDE-Consent-27560]]] guidance on implementing consent records with DPV based on the ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023 technical specification.</p>
      </aside>
        <aside class="example" title="Consent record example">
<p>This (simplified) example shows a consent record containing the topic of consent (i.e. which processing activities it was about), its current status, and when it was given by the data subject. The structure of a record is highly dependent on the requirements of the use-case, and can vary across implementations. In this case, it is based on the ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023 Privacy technologies — Consent record information structure, for which we provide the implementation guide [[[GUIDE-Consent-27560]]].</p><p>The example uses the <a href="https://dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/">DCMI Metadata Terms (dct)</a> vocabulary to indicate metadata such as title and timestamps. Other vocabularies such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/">PROV-O</a> can be used to also indicate provenance information such as when it was generated and how it was produced.</p>    <div class="source" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre class='nohighlight'style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span>:<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">63ded36f-4acd-4f3c-991e-6cb636698523</span> <span style="color: #B00040">a</span> <span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">dpv</span>:<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">ConsentRecord</span> ;

      <h4>Security</h4>
      <p>All technical and organisational measures are intended, by definition, to provide better security and handling of personal data and its associated processing and other activities. In DPV's taxonomy, some measures directly and specifically relate to security as their topic, whilst others provide their intended benefit indirectly. For example, the concept <code>SecurityAssessments</code> is an organisational measure relating to how security is assessed (and thus ultimately improved) - and is directly associated with security as a topic. Whereas a concept such as <code>ProfessionalTraining</code> relates to measures that are not directly tied to security, but can be associated in cases where the training is related to security or specific security measures or risks (e.g. cybersecurity data breach mitigations). The purpose <code>EnforceSecurity</code> provides a common umbrella term for personal data that is utilised for enacting and enforcing security measures, such as for authorisation and authentication.</p>
      <p>Technical measures that relate specifically to security include <code>SecurityMethod</code> for providing security, and its subtypes for <code>DocumentSecurity</code>, <code>FileSystemSecurity</code>, <code>HardwareSecurityProtocols</code>, <code>IntrusionDetectionSystem</code>, <code>MobilePlatformSecurity</code>, <code>NetworkSecurityProtocols</code>, <code>OperatingSystemSecurity</code>, <code>WebBrowserSecurity</code>, <code>WebSecurityProtocols</code>, and more. Organisational measures that relate specifically to security include <code>SecurityProcedure</code>, and its subtypes for <code>BackgroundChecks</code>, <code>CybersecurityAssessments</code>, <code>CybersecurityTraining</code>, <code>SecurityAssessments</code>, and more.</p>

      <h4>Data Processing Agreements</h4>
      <p>The term <i>Data Processing Agreement</i> refers to a broad concept related to contracts or agreements between entities representing conditions regarding the processing of (personal-)data. This can include ad-hoc 'data handling' policies such as NDAs, embargoes, and enforcement of practices, as well as more formal and legal binding contractual obligations such as those between a Controller and a Processor.</p>
      <p>To represent such concepts, DPV provides <code>LegalAgreement</code>, along with subtypes for <code>NDA</code> (Non-disclosure agreements), <code>ContractualTerms</code>, and <code>DataProcessingAgreement</code>. In these, it is important to remember that while <i>contract</i> can also be as a form of legal basis, the concept represented here is not necessarily the same <i>contract</i> as that is used to justify the processing of personal data with a data subject. Instead, <i>contracts</i> are a broad category representing contractual terms governing data handling within or with an entity.</p>
      <p>For representing specific agreements between entities (other than those with data subjects - which are covered in Legal Basis taxonomy), DPV provides the following types of agreements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>ControllerProcessorAgreement</code>: An agreement between a Controller and a Processor, where the Controller instructs the Processor(s) to carry out processing on its behalf.</li>
        <li><code>JointControllersAgreement</code>: An agreement between two or more Controllers to act as a 'Joint Controller'.</li>
        <li><code>SubProcessorAgreement</code>: An agreement between two or more Processors where one Processor instructs another to carry out processing on its behalf.</li>
        <li><code>ThirdPartyAgreement</code>: An agreement between a Data Controller or a Data Processor, and a Third Party. Note that this is a loosely defined concept, as depending on the jurisdiction, this relationship may result in the Third Party being a Data Controller or a Joint Data Controller.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To indicate the entities involved in an agreement, the relation <code>hasEntity</code> can be used, or relations associated with specific roles to indicate contextuality. For example, using <code>hasDataController</code> with a <code>ControllerProcessorAgreement</code> denotes the Data Controller for that agreement.</p>

      <h4>Data Transfer Safeguards</h4>
      <p>While all technical and organisational measures are intended to safeguard personal data and its associated activities, there may be contextual or use-case requirements to explicitly indicate safeguards against or for specific criteria. To enable such use, DPV provides the concept <code>Safeguard</code> and its subtype <code>SafeguardForDataTransfer</code> for indicating application when data is being transferred. Through these, it is possible to represent aspects such as policies for data transfers, specific measures such as encryption being applied, and other pertinent information in combination with DPV's concepts from technical and organisational measures.</p>
