    <figcaption>Overview of Purpose taxonomy in DPV (click to open in new window)</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>DPV provides a taxonomy of Purpose <i>instances</i> for use with [=hasPurpose=] relation. In addition, DPV also defines the concept [=Sector=] (associated using [=hasSector=]) to indicate a contextual interpretation of the purpose within a specified sector.</p>
  <p>DPV’s taxonomy of purposes is used to represent the <em>reason</em> or <em>justification</em> for processing of personal data. For this, purposes are organised within DPV based on how they relate to the processing of personal data in terms of several factors, such as: management functions related to information (e.g. records, account, finance), fulfilment of objectives (e.g. delivery of goods), providing goods and services (e.g. service provision), intended benefits (e.g. optimisations for service provider or consumer), and legal compliance.</p>
    <div class="note" title="Purposes do not have a strict structure as used in real-world use-cases">
      <p>It is important to note the following for real-world implications of <code>Purpose</code>:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <p>There is no universal definition for what constitutes a ’purpose’ or what attributes are associated with it.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>There are several distinct ways to model purposes, e.g. as a ‘goal’ such as ‘Delivery of Ordered Goods’; or as a statement explaining the processing of personal data, e.g. ‘Sending newsletters to Email’.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>DPV does not define requirements for what is a ‘valid purpose’ as these are defined externally, e.g. in laws such as [[GDPR]] Article.5-1b where purposes are required to be ‘explicit and legitimate’.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Purposes have contextual interpretations within their application and domains (i.e. depending on how they are used in an use-case). For example, <code>ServiceProvision</code> is interpreted differently across the use-cases of an online website, a goods delivery outlet, and a medical centre - even if they use the same terms or phrasing.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <p>Following from the above, practical uses of DPV will likely need to extend one of the concepts within DPV’s purpose taxonomy to ensure its purpose descriptions are specific and understandable within the context of that use-case. We therefore suggest, where possible and appropriate, to create a customised purpose as required within the use-cases by extending one or several purposes from the DPV taxonomy and to provide a human readable description to assist in its accurate interpretation (e.g. DPV prefers use of <code>skos:prefLabel</code> for its concepts and <code>dct:title</code> for other documentation).</p>
      <aside class="example" title="Extending Purposes and adding human-readable descriptions">
<p>In this example, a new purpose is created by extending <code>dpv:FraudPreventionAndDetection</code> and annotated with human-readable information. The interpretation of this purpose is thus more clear in relation to how it is applied or used within that use-case, and also serves to compare it with other purposes within the same category.</p>    <div class="source" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre class='nohighlight'style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">ex</span>:<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">PreventTransactionFraud</span> <span style="color: #B00040">a</span> <span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">dpv</span>:<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">Purpose</span> ;

    <h2>Guidelines on Purposes</h2>
    <p>DPV's purpose taxonomy enables expressing the <i>category</i> of purpose i.e the broader goal or reason. To enable accurate representation of purposes, we recommend further describing the purposes in a contextual manner where relevant. For example, the concept [=Marketing=] refers to the broad purpose of 'marketing', which may not be sufficient to represent information such as the marketing is about a specific campaign associated with the holiday season. Such additional details are necessary to understand where the 'initial' purpose may differ with 'subsequent' purposes of data. For example, if consent was given only for the use of personal data for marketing during holiday seasons, other non-holiday marketing purposes would not be compatible with it. Additional details can be added to DPV purposes by two methods: (1) extending the DPV taxonomy; and (2) adding annotations containing human-readable descriptions. We recommend always using (2), and using (1) where necessary or relevant.</p>
    <p>To enable the accurate representations of purposes, we also recommend choosing the most relevant or closest concept from purpose taxonomy so that the purpose is as specific as possible. For example, choosing [=ProvidePersonalisedRecommendations=] instead of [=Personalisation=] allows communicating that the personalisation is of a specific kind and that other kinds of personalisations such as for UI/UX or advertising are not part of this purpose.</p>
      <aside class="example" title="Extending a purpose and using human-readable descriptions">
<p>This example describes how a purpose can be made clearer and accurate by two methods: (1) providing a human-readable description - which is always recommended; and (2) by extending a DPV concept    <div class="source" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre class='nohighlight'style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">ex</span>:<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">PDH</span> <span style="color: #B00040">a</span> <span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">dpv</span>:<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">Process</span> ;

    <h2>Service Provision</h2>
    <p>For purposes associated with [=ServiceProvision=], DPV provides concepts such as [=PaymentManagement=], [=ServiceOptimisation=], and [=ServiceRegistration=] amongst others. To associate these with services, the `Service` concept can be used similar to how `Process` is used to structure related information together. In this manner, a service can be expressed in terms of the different purposes and processes it contains - which may have their own separate legal basis.</p>

    <h2>Sector of Purpose Application</h2>
    <p>DPV provides <code>Sector</code> that can be used to indicate the relevant information to further clarify or indicate how a purpose should be interpreted. <code>Sector</code>, used with the <code>hasSector</code> relation, denotes the <i>sector</i> or <i>domain</i> of application, such as Manufacturing. This can be used alongside existing official sector taxonomies such as [[NACE]] (EU), [[NAICS]] (USA), or [[ISIC]] (UN), as well as commercial industry taxonomies such as [[GICS]] maintained by organisations MSCI and S&amp;P. Multiple classifications can be used through mappings between sector codes such as the [[[NACE-NAICS]]] provided by EU.</p>
    <p>The DPVCG welcomes discussions on the alignment of concepts in NACE, NAICS, ISIC, and GICS with DPV's Purpose taxonomy to further expand on how specific purposes can be represented within the context of a particular domain or sector.</p>

    <div class="note" title="Discontinuation of DPV-NACE extension">
      <p>DPVCG initially provided an interpretation of the NACE revision 2 codes which uses <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code> to specify the hierarchy between sector concepts instead of the SKOS relations used in NACE. In 2.0, the NACE extension has been removed as there was no added benefits provided in DPV's NACE extension and the recommendation is to use the official/authoritative NACE concepts and IRIs. Further, NACE revision 2.1 has been published which should be reffered to as the latest version.</p>

  <p>While the use of <code>Sector</code> for restricting (personal data processing) purposes is an uncommon and undocumented practice in terms of legal enforcement, we provide this feature as the use of sector code can assist with identification and interpretation of information as well as legal or organisational obligations and policies. For example, indicating some purpose is to be implemented within manufacturing or scientific research facilities (e.g. medical centres) can assist in ensuring specific types of access control and policies are defined and implemented.</p>
