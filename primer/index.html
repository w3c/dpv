  <section id="introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/dpvcg/">[[[DPVCG]]]</a> was formed in 2018 through the <a href="https://www.specialprivacy.eu/">[[[SPECIAL]]]</a> with the ambition of providing a machine-readable and interoperable vocabulary for representing information about the use and processing of personal data, whilst inviting perspectives and contributions from a diverse set of stakeholders across computer science, IT, law, sociology, philosophy – representing academia, industry, policy-makers, and activists. It identified the following issues through the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/vocabws/report">W3C Workshop on Privacy and Linked Data</a>:
      <ol type="a">
        <li>lack of standardised vocabularies to represent concepts related to personal data, and who/how/where it is processed;</li>
        <li>lack of descriptive taxonomies that describe how purposes of processing personal data which are not restricted to a particular domain or use-case; and</li>
        <li>lack of machine-readable representations of concepts that can be used for technical interoperability of information.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>The outcome of addressing these resulted in the creation of the <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv">[[[DPV]]]</a>, which provides a vocabulary and ontology for expressing information related to processing of personal data, entities involved and their roles, details of technologies utilised, relation to laws and legal justifications permitting its use, and other relevant concepts based on privacy and data protection. While it uses the EU’s [[[GDPR]]] as a guiding source for the creation and interpretation of concepts, the ambition and scope of DPV is to provide a broad globally useful vocabulary that can be extended to jurisdiction or domain specific applications.</p>
    <p>People, organisations, laws, and use-cases have different perspectives and interpretations of concepts and requirements which cannot be modelled into a single coherent universal vocabulary. The aim of DPV is to provide a foundational framework of ‘<i>common concepts</i>’ that can be extended to represent specific laws, domains, or applications. This lets any two entities agree that a term, for example, <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#PersonalData"><code>PersonalData</code></a>, refers to the same semantic concept, even though they might apply it differently within their own use-cases.</p>
    <p>While most of DPV is focused on processing of personal data, it also supports representing uses of non-personal data and representing technologies such as cloud services and AI. Through these concepts, DPV enables supporting regulations and use-cases which affect use of both personal and non-personal data - such as the [[[DGA]]], and regulations which regulate technologies such as [[[NIS2]]] and [[[AIAct]]].

      <h3>Structure of DPV</h3>

        <figcaption>Structure of DPV vocabularies where DPV defines the core concepts which are then extended in specific extensions</figcaption>
      </figure>
    <p>DPV provides hierarchical taxonomies of concepts where each <code>core concept</code> represents the top-most abstract concept in a tree and each of its children provide a lesser abstract or more concrete concept. For example, consider the concept of <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#PersonalData"><code>PersonalData</code></a> which is the abstract representation of <em>personal data</em>. It can be further <i>refined</i> or <i>extended</i> as <code>SensitivePersonalData</code>, and further as <code>SpecialCategoryPersonalData</code> and then as <code>GeneticData</code> and so on.</p>
    <p>From this perspective, the top-most abstract concepts are collectively referred to as the <i>core vocabulary</i> within DPV. The goal of the DPV is to provide a rich collection of concepts for each of the top concepts so as to enable their application within real-world use-cases. The identification of what constitutes a core concept is based on the need to represent information about it in a modular and independent form, such as that required for legal compliance.</p>
    <p>Each core concept is intended to be independent from other core concepts. For example, the <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#Purpose"><code>Purpose</code></a> (e.g. <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv">Optimisation</a>) refers only to the <i>purpose of why personal data is processed</i> and is independent as a concept from the <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#PersonalData"><code>PersonalData</code></a> (e.g. <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv/pd#Location"><code>Location</code></a>) or the <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#Processing"><code>Processing</code></a> activities (e.g. <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#Collect"><code>Collect</code></a>, <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#Store"><code>Store</code></a>) involved to carry out that purpose. Such separation is necessary in order to represent and answer questions such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Q:</i> What data is being processed? <br/><i>Ans:</i> <code>dpv:PersonalData</code> → <code>dpv:Email</code></li>
      <li><i>Q:</i> Why is the data being processed? <br/><i>Ans:</i> <code>dpv:Purpose</code> → <code>dpv:Marketing</code></li>
      <li><i>Q:</i> What operations are done with the data? <br/><i>Ans:</i> <code>dpv:Processing</code> → <code>dpv:Collect</code>, <code>dpv:Store</code></li>
      <li><i>Q:</i> What justification is used to do the processing? <br/><i>Ans:</i> <code>dpv:LegalBasis</code> → <code>dpv:Consent</code>, <code>dpv:Contract</code></li>
      <li><i>Q:</i> How is the data directly or indirectly being protected? <br/><i>Ans:</i> <code>dpv:TechnicalOrganisationalMeasure</code> → <code>dpv:AccessControlMethod</code>, <code>dpv:PrivacyByDesign</code></li>
      <li><i>Q:</i> What rights are associated with the processing of data? <br/><i>Ans:</i> <code>dpv:Right</code> → <code>dpv:ActiveRight</code>, <code>dpv:PassiveRight</code></li>  
      <li><i>Q:</i> What are the risks associated with processing of data? <br/><i>Ans:</i> <code>dpv:Risk</code> → <code>dpv:RiskLevel</code>, <code>dpv:Severity</code></li>
      <li><i>Q:</i> What is the contextual information associated with processing? <br/><i>Ans:</i> <code>dpv:Context</code> → <code>dpv:Duration</code>, <code>dpv:Scale</code></li>
      
    </ul>
    <p>The separation of concepts creates a <i>modular</i> structure for concept hierarchies within DPV, which in turn allows an adopter to use one particular concept taxonomy or module (e.g. list of purposes) independently without reusing the others, or to select only those concepts which are needed for their particular use-case. The separation also permits greater flexibility of representation and usage - such as using different combinations of core concepts as needed in use-cases. For example, a use-case can specify a single concept representing both Purpose and Processing by combining their respective concepts from DPV. The modular design of DPV also makes it possible to define domain and jurisdiction specific concepts in a separate namespace - such as the [[[DPV-NACE]]] purpose taxonomy</u></a> providing a way for <code>Purpose</code> to indicate sectors using NACE taxonomy, and the [[[EU-GDPR]]] for using <code>LegalBasis</code> to represent the legal bases provided by [[GDPR]].</p>

    <p>‘Personal data’ refers to data about a natural person. ‘Personal data’ is also commonly referred to as ‘personally identifiable information (PII)’. However the terms should not be interchangeably used as based on definitions (e.g. those in GDPR), ‘personal data’ can be interpreted as a broader term than PII, and where PII may refer <u>only</u> to information that can directly identify a person. DPV’s definition of personal data is based on the broadest possible definition (i.e. from GDPR) as it covers a wider range of information considered ‘personal data’. Personal data can be declared as a category, such as ‘<i>Email</i>’, or an instance, such as ‘<i>x@y.z</i>’.</p>
    <p>DPV defines the concept <code>Data</code> which has subtypes <code>NonPersonalData</code> and <code>PersonalData</code>, which are associated using the relation <code>hasData</code>. To specifically indicate involvement of personal data, DPV provides the relation <code>hasPersonalData</code>.</p></section>

To indicate the origin or source of data, the concept <code>DataSource</code> along with relation <code>hasDataSource</code> is provided. For additional <i>contextual</i> information regarding operations or processing, such as whether it include humans or automation, the concept <code>ProcessingContext</code> is provided which can be associated using the relation <code>hasContext</code> (description of <code>Context</code> is provided later in the document).

    <p> A legal basis is a law or a clause in a law that justifies or permits the processing of personal data or use of technologies in the specified manner. It is a jurisdictional concept given the scoping of laws to specified countries or regions, as well as a domain-specific concept given the specific laws enacted scoped to particular domains. A law, such as the GDPR, that regulates the use of personal data requires that every processing of personal data must be justified with some legal basis to ensure it is lawful, and to further assess its correctness, accountability, and impact based on the obligations applicable. However, what is considered a legal basis varies greatly across cultures, domains, use-cases, and laws themselves. The aim of DPV is therefore to provide an upper-level abstract taxonomy of categories of legal bases, such as consent and contract, that can be customised and applied as needed.</p>

    <p>DPV provides a taxonomy of technical and organisational measures for representing information about how the processing of personal data is technically and organisationally protected, safeguarded, secured, or otherwise managed. This is distinct from what technology is used for carrying out processing, and instead refers to what <i>measures</i> are in place (i.e. what the technology intends to provide in terms of features).</p>
    <p>Technical and Organisational measures consist of activities, processes, or procedures used in connection with ensuring data protection, carrying out processing in a secure manner, and complying with legal obligations. Such measures are required by regulations depending on the context of processing involving personal data. For example, GDPR (Article 32) states implementing appropriate measures by taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing, as well as risks, rights and freedoms.</p>

      <p>The concept <code>Right</code> represents a normative concept for what is permissible or necessary in accordance with a system such as laws. To associate rights with concepts that are relevant or within which those rights occur, the relation <code>hasRight</code> is used. Rights can be <i>passive</i>, which means they are always applicable without requiring anything to be done, or <i>active</i> where they require some action to be taken to initiate or exercise them. To represent these concepts, DPV uses <code>PassiveRight</code> and <code>ActiveRight</code> respectively. Rights can be applicable to different contexts or entities. To differentiate rights applicable or afforded to data subjects, the concept <code>DataSubjectRight</code> is used.</p>

      <p>Rules are relevant to explicitly denote how a system should implement operations, and enable associating specifics such as requirements, constraints, and other forms of 'rules' that are needed in order to control executions or affect interpretations or achieve compliance (e.g. with law). DPV defines the concept <code>Rule</code> and relation <code>hasRule</code> to enable representation of such conditions and requirements, and provides a minimal set of concepts for types of rules, namely - representing Permissions, Prohibitions, and Obligations. DPV does not define additional semantics for rules and limits its scope and focus to provide a simple way to specify common rules associated with personal data and its processing activities, with the recommendation to consider other richer and mature efforts dedicated to expression of conditions and rules, such as: [[ODRL]], [[SHACL]], and [[RuleML]].</p>

    <p>In legal terminology, it is common to refer to all information about how personal data is being processed using the colloquial term <i>processing</i>. This results in confusion between the use of <i>processing</i> as a concept referring to all information (i.e. purposes, personal data, collection, storage, etc.), and <code>processing</code> as a concept referring to (only) the specific actions or operations (e.g. collect, use).</p>
    <p>To avoid this ambiguity and enable clarity of information, DPV defines a new concept called <code>Process</code> for representing how the <a href="#core-concepts">core concepts</a> are combined and applied for a particular use-case. The association of a concept to <code>Process</code> is made using the relationships or properties provided for each concept. For example, to indicate a <code>Process</code> includes personal data, the relationship <code>hasPersonalData</code> is used along with the concept <code>PersonalData</code>.</p>
    <aside class="note" title="Process from DPV v2 is a replacement for PersonalDataHandling from DPV v1">
      <p>In DPV v1, the concept <code>PersonalDataHandling</code> was defined to represent the combination of core concepts. In DPV v2, this role is fulfilled by <code>Process</code> which is a term more closely aligned with practical uses and the vocabulary used by various entities e.g. business process. For backwards compatibility, <code>PersonalDataHandling</code> is defined as a subclass or subtype of <code>Process</code>.</p>
    </aside>
      <aside class="example" title="Process used to combine core concepts and represent an use-case">

<section class="notoc"><h4>Nesting <code>Process</code> to express granular models</h4>
    <p>Instances of <code>Process</code> can be nested, which means one instance can contain other instances, much like a box with several smaller boxes inside. This permits breaking down complex or dense use-cases into more granular ones and representing them in a more precise and modular fashion. Such a representation also facilitates reuse of the granular or modular processes, or in defining 'templates' and 'patterns', for example to craft a single process representing collecting and storing email addresses and using it in different processes for different purposes.</p>
    <p>From the earlier example, consider the situation where a single <code>Process</code> instance consists of two additional instances representing: (i) data is stored using a data processor, (ii) data is used for Marketing. While it is certainly possible to represent all of this information within one single instance of <code>Process</code>, the adopter may decide to create separate instances of <code>Process</code> based on requirements such as reflecting similar separations for legal documentation or accountability purposes.</p>
      <aside class="example" title="Nesting Processes">
<p>Consider the example where <em>Acme</em>, as a <em>DataController</em>, maintains records of its processing activities using <code>Process</code> to represent one of its services. In this, it collects email, uses it for internal analyses based on <em>Legitimate Interests</em>, and also sends marketing information by using a processor based on the data subject's consent. Using nesting of processes, the information can be expressed at a granular level representing service, individual purposes, and so on.</p>    <div class="source" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre class='nohighlight'style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #00F; font-weight: bold">ex</span>:<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">Acme</span> <span style="color: #00F; font-weight: bold">rdf</span>:<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">type</span> <span style="color: #00F; font-weight: bold">dpv</span>:<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">DataController</span> .

<section class="notoc"><h4>Alternative Models</h4>
    <p><code>Process</code> is intended to provide a convenient concept for tying the core concepts together, and DPV does not make its use binding, nor does it constrain the relationships to only be defined between <code>Process</code> and the other core concepts. This is so as to permit using DPV in alternate or differing models. For example, where a central concept already exists, such as when describing relevant information for a smartphone app, the concept for <code>App</code> can be a replacement for <code>Process</code> based on statements such as <code>&lt;App&gt; hasPurpose &lt;SomePurpose&gt;</code>. Even in such cases, <code>Process</code> can provide granular expression thereby enabling description of different contexts within which the app uses personal data, such as for registration or complaint resolution. Therefore unless necessary for the use-case, DPV recommends using <code>Process</code> or its subtype/subclass as a central concept for ensuring interoperability.</p>
    <p>An example of where the adopter or use-case wants to use another concept in a way which is not compatible with <code>Purpose</code> is the use of <code>Purpose</code> to indicate it involves some data i.e. <code>&lt;SomePurpose hasPersonalData SomePersonalData&gt;</code>, or to indicate which legal basis is used for that purpose by using the <code>hasLegalBasis</code> relationship. While not explicitly prohibited by DPV, the implications of using <code>Purpose</code> in this manner is that the personal data and processing and other associated concepts are now strictly tied to the purpose instance (and implementation). Changing any of these would mean changing the purpose, and in addition to these, it is not possible to combine multiple purposes together or have nested purposes with different details in the same manner as with a <code>Process</code>. Therefore, DPVCG recommends the use of <code>Process</code> to ensure compatibility between use-cases as well as to ensure the use of concepts does not create ambiguity or restrict further use-cases from reusing existing information.</p>
    <!-- <p>The following figure indicates an alternate model which does not use <code>Process</code> as a central concept, but instead uses the core concepts and relationships to structure information related to a <i>Service</i>.</p>

    <div class="note" title="Consequences of using a different model than Process">
    <p>When using custom-defined restrictions and data models, it is important to note the consequences such models have on interpretation and interoperability of data defined using DPV. For example, consider a compliance assessment tool that takes DPV data as input. If the tool expects a <code>Process</code> with links to relevant information, using other alternate models and relationships can produce invalid or incorrect results. To avoid this, we recommend:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <p>Documenting alternate models to clearly indicate their interpretation and use of DPV semantics;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Where possible, ensuring and providing mappings between the alternate models and the <code>Process</code> or equivalent concepts within DPV so that the data can be transformed for interoperability;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Consider contributing your idea or implementation of an alternate model to DPVCG to create a ‘library of models’, which can act as documentation for adopters and provide better understanding of the model's impacts on requirements and interpretation of information specified using DPV. This exercise can also assist in selecting a common model as the 'default' and to provide mechanisms for conversion/interoperability between it and other models.</p>

    <h2>Using DPV</h2>
    <p>The motivation of DPV is to provide a '<i>data model</i>' or an '<i>ontology</i>' of concepts for interoperable representation and exchange of information about processing of (personal) data and the use of technologies. For this, the DPV specification defines concepts and relationships using the [[RDF]] standard, and which can additionally be implemented and applied using technologies appropriate to a use-case's specific requirements.</p>
    <section id="serialisations">
    <h3>DPV Serialisations</h3>
    <p>In addition to being used as a semantic web resource, the DPV can also be used without (or alongside) semantic web by utilising a format such as [[JSON-LD]] that retains the semantics and provides convenience of using JSON, or through other formats such as a CSV or a flat-list of concepts which do not capture 'semantics'. This section provides an overview of such approaches where DPV can be used both with and without semantic web.</p>
    <p>The following are four (non-exhaustive) ways DPV can be used based on the requirements of an use-case. For guidance on how to adopt DPV concepts within an use-case, refer to [[[GUIDES]]].</p>
    <ol>
    <li>As a <b>taxonomy or collection of concepts</b>: The [[DPV]] specification provides taxonomies of concepts (e.g. <code>Purpose</code>). This is useful where only the 'taxonomy' in DPV is needed, for example to populate forms or annotate information. For this, the default serialisation of [[SKOS]] is useful, or implementers can utilise other formats such as CSV or JSON while retaining the IRIs for interoperability.</li>
    <li>As a <b>'schema' or 'lightweight-ontology'</b>: The [[DPV]] uses [[RDFS]] and [[SKOS]] as its default serialisation to define 'classes' and 'properties' as well as 'taxonomies' that can be used with it (e.g. <code>hasPurpose</code> and instances of <code>Purpose</code> taxonomy). The classes and properties form a 'data model' or 'schema' to represent how information should be structured and organised, and do not contain any complex restrictions (e.g. unions and intersections of concepts). It is suitable for cases where the use-case wants to use DPV as a schema or data model or to describe its activities, and where creating constraints, inferences, or reasoning is either implemented separately (e.g. SWRL or SHACL) or is not required.</li>
    <li>As an <b>'logic-based ontology'</b>: The [[DPV-OWL]] is a serialisation of the [[DPV]] specification using [[OWL]] language that contains the same concepts but is provided under a separate namespace. It enables the use of description logic in [[OWL]] for modelling knowledge and describing desired inferences through a logic-based reasoner. OWL offers more powerful (and complex) features compared to RDFS+SKOS regarding expression of information and its use to produce desired inferences in a coherent manner. It also restricts ways in which DPV concepts can be used - see <a href="#example-implications-of-using-skos-vs-owl">example showing implications of using SKOS vs OWL</a>. Also see the [[[GUIDE-OWL2]]].</li>
    <li><b>Other Uses</b>: For cases where the above are not suitable or sufficient, an adopter can create their own serialisation of the DPV by implementing the [[DPV]] specification in RDF (or other semantics-aware languages) or for alternate formats and environments such as CSV, programming APIs, and frameworks. When using DPV in such a manner, it is advised to retain compatibility (and interoperability) by either using the entire IRI (e.g. <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#Purpose">https://w3id.org/dpv#Purpose</a>) or providing documentation for how the custom implementation aligns with the [[DPV]] specification (e.g. stating <em>MyPurposeConcept</em> is the same as <code>dpv:Purpose</code>). Doing this ensures that the data remains compatible and interoperable with the other uses and applications of DPV.</li>

      <li><b>Document annotation</b> - identifying and annotating concepts within documents such as privacy policies, legal compliance documentation, web pages;</li>
      </li>
      <li><b>Representing Policies</b> – expressing policies for how personal data should be ‘handled’, policies for describing an use-cases’ use of personal data such as those required for representing consent, contracts, and data sharing agreements;
      </li>

<section id="semantics-of-dpv">
    <h2>Semantics of DPV</h2>
    <p>DPV defines a broad notion of semantics for providing a <i>conceptual</i> model of concepts and relationships between them. As explained in the [[[#serialisations]]] section, [[DPV]] provides concepts which are represented using [[RDFS]] and [[SKOS]] which permits its use as a taxonomy or as a light-weight ontology. In addition to this, the same concepts are provided with [[OWL]] serialisation in a separate namespace to enable complex ontological reasoning. The following section introduces why we need 'concepts' and 'relationships' and how they are modelled in DPV.</p>
    <section id="concepts-relationships">
      <h3>Concepts and Relationships</h3>
      <p>[[DPV]] is a collection of <i>concepts</i>. Here the term 'concept' is broadly used as consisting of a <i>term</i> non-exhaustively representing any of the following: idea, thought, meaning, object, event, relations, class, or category. Thus, in DPV, 'concepts' consist of terms and relationships between them.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../2.0/diagrams/concepts_relations.svg"/>
        <figcaption>Semantic relationships between concepts used in DPV - generalisation and specialisation (arrowhead), instantiation, and association</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <aside class="example">
        <p>Consider the example scenario where we want to express the following: Alpha is a <i>DataController</i> that <i>collects</i> <i>Email</i> as <i>PersonalData</i>, <i>stores</i> it, and <i>shares</i> it with BetaInc (a <i>Data Processor</i>), all for <i> official correspondence</i>.</p>
        <p>In this, the 'core' concepts are: <code>Data Controller</code>, <code>Personal Data</code>, <code>Processing</code>, <code>Data Processor</code>, and <code>Purpose</code>. Email is another concept that is a specific 'type' or 'subset' or 'category' of Personal Data. Similarly, Processing has 'collects', 'stores', and 'shares'. Alpha is a specific 'instance' of a Data Controller, and similarly BetaInc of a Data Processor.</p>
        <p>Here the difference between 'Email' and 'Alpha' is that the former could be further described in terms of the same concept, e.g. Email Address is a specific part of Email as Personal Data; while the latter is 'final' in the sense that it cannot be 'extended' further without losing its meaning. For example, if 'Alpha' has a department or subsidiary, then either of those are not a 'Data Controller' automatically.</p>
        <p>In addition to concepts, the above example also requires expressing these <i>relationships</i>: (i) a concept is a 'subtype' or 'subset' of another concept; (ii) a concept is an 'instance' of another concept; (iii) indicating a concept is applicable or involved. These relationships are expressed as <i>is subtype of</i>, <i>is instance of</i>, and <i>has concept</i> respectively.</p>
        <p>Combining all of these together, we say the following in DPV:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>PersonalData, Purpose, Processing, Data Controller, Data Processor are instances of Concept</li>
          <li>Email is a subtype of Personal Data. Collect, Store, and Share are subtypes of Processing. Official Correspondence is a subtype of Purpose.</li>
          <li>Alpha is an instance of a Data Controller. BetaInc is an instance of a Data Processor.</li>
          <li>The use-case "<code>has personal data := Email</code>"; "<code>has processing := Collect, Store, Share</code>" ; and so on...</li>
          <li><code>has personal data</code> is a relation linking to <code>Personal Data</code>, <code>has processing</code> is a relation linking to a <code>Processing</code>, and so on ...</li>
        </ul>
      </aside>
      
      <p>A ‘concept' in DPV is a 'term' representing information associated with that particular concept. For example, the concept <code>Email</code> refers to information about <em>emails</em>. This information may contain <i>email addresses, aliases, signatures</i>, and so on. While an intuitive use of <code>Email</code> may be taken to only refer to <i>email address</i>, within DPV concepts are defined with a strict scope as being representatives of all concepts that are inherently a part of it. Therefore, for emails, the concept <code>Email</code> is inclusive of email addresses, aliases, and so on from above. To specifically refer to 'email address', the concept <code>Email Address</code> should be used, which is 'narrower' or 'more specific' than the concept <code>Email</code>, or in terms of sets <code>EmailAddress</code> is a subset of <code>Email</code>, or if representing information as 'classes' we say <code>EmailAddress</code> is a 'subclass' of <code>Email</code> in terms of information. We use the term 'subtype' to indicate all such relationships consisting of 'broader/narrower' or 'superclass/subclass' or 'subset/superset' to enable different semantic interpretations when serialising the concepts using standards such as [[RDFS]], [[SKOS]], and [[OWL]] (e.g. 'is-a' or 'subclass'). </p>
      <p>Through this interpretation, the DPV is structured as a hierarchy of concepts where each <i>parent or top or broader concept</i> represents a broad set of information and its <i>children or bottom or narrower concepts</i> represent parts of that set. For example, the top concept <code>Data</code> has more specific subtypes <code>Personal Data</code> - which has a further subtype <code>Sensitive Data</code>.</p>
    
    <aside class="note" title="Caution against ambiguous interpretation of terms in practice">
      <p>In the real-world, concepts are not used with the formal and logical consistency expected. Instead, general concepts are used to represent its entire category, which is also why DPV concepts are structured in a top-down fashion. To better reflect a use-case and to ensure accuracy of interpretation when using DPV, it is strongly recommended to either choose concepts which are as detailed or closer to the actual intended usage of that concept, and/or to find a suitable concept and extend it to reflect the specifics as accurately as possible.</p>
    </aside>
    <p>In taking this view of concepts and relationships, DPV provides a way to agree upon what a <i>term</i> means and is intended to represent. For example, when two different use-cases use the concept <i>Personal Data</i> using DPV, both refer to the <i>same concept</i>. Similarly, when Email is declared as a subtype of Personal Data, another entity receiving and reading this information must interpret it in the same manner. DPV is thus intended to be a foundational model for terms and relationships when representing and exchanging information.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="classes-hierarchies-and-instances">
    <h3>DPV as an Ontology</h3>
    <p>The use of DPV concepts in actual use-cases is often accompanied with additional information and a specific 'serialisation' that make it possible to use DPV in a given technological or theoretical framework. For example, consider the relation <code>hasPersonalData</code> used to indicate association or applicability of <code>PersonalData</code> subtypes/subclasses or instances. While this information about what concepts the relationship is being used with/for can be implicitly understood by humans based on the phrasing 'has personal data', it can also be explicitly declared as machine-readable information so as to: (i) express the inherent logic and interpretation of which concepts are related; (ii) enable verification that the object of relation is indeed a type of personal data; and (iii) provide hints or suggestions such as a list of personal data concepts in GUI when using the relation. To express such additional information that defines relations between concepts and constraints their uses, DPV must be specified as an 'ontology' using a serialisation that supports representing this and any other required information.</p>
    <p>One option to represent ontologies is RDF ([[[RDF]]]) which provides a formal method for expressing information or facts, with RDFS ([[[RDFS]]]), SKOS ([[[SKOS]]]), and OWL ([[[OWL]]]) for representing a more detailed and logic-based assertion of the model in terms of relationships and restrictions. While there are other alternatives available to RDF for representing information, and to RDFS, SKOS, and OWL for representing taxonomies and ontologies, the DPVCG uses these to serialise the DPV specification as an ontology based on their status as standards.</p>
    <p>Initially, DPV was only provided as an [[OWL]] ontology. This was expanded upon in DPV v1 which used custom [[SKOS]] extensions to define the 'core' vocabulary with serialisations in [[RDFS]]+[[SKOS]] and OWL2. In DPV v2, the custom [[SKOS]] extensions were removed in favour of [[RDFS]]+[[SKOS]] as the default serialisation with [[OWL]] as an alternative serialisation. The [[RDFS]]+[[SKOS]] serialisation defines concepts as [[RDFS]] classes and instances of a top-concept with [[SKOS]] used to represent the hierarchy, whereas the [[OWL]] serialisation uses subclasses to represent the hierarchy.</p>
    <p>The table provides an overview of the expression of concepts across DPV serialisations.</p>

      <aside class="example" title="Implications of using SKOS vs OWL">
<p>This example highlights the implications of using DPV with RDFS+SKOS and OWL semantics. The RDFS+SKOS model is suitable for when DPV concepts have to be used 'directly' e.g. an use-case wants to use 'Encryption' from DPV as a technical measure without creating a specific 'instance' representing their implementation of the encryption. RDFS+SKOS model is also suitable for when an use-case wants to further create an hierarchical taxonomy of the different 'Encryption' concepts they are using. Such use of DPV concepts covers both T-box and A-box, and does not restrict or require the underlying ontology/schema to be constantly changed as new concepts are identified in an use-case.</p>
      <p>In comparison, the OWL2 model defines concepts as classes and instances with a clear separation between the two i.e. the Tbox and Abox are separate. This means the concept 'Encryption' cannot be directly used with OWL2 semantics and an instance of it must first be created. If instead DPV had provided 'Encryption' as an instance (of Technical Measure) then the further expansion and creation of a hierarchy of encryption concepts described earlier is not feasible in OWL2 as it results in a complex graph which is not efficient for reasoning. Further, making changes such as promoting 'Encryption' from instance to class requires changing the ontology/schema - which may not always be possible or feasible in use-cases.</p>
      <p>Thus, the relative strengths and weaknesses of RDFS+SKOS and OWL2 serialisations dictate which should be used. RDFS+SKOS is 'lightweight' and better if the use-case only requires rudimentary or simple reasoning. OWL2 is  better suited for semantic reasoners that can perform complex discovery and validation processes but require more strict and restricted use of concepts. By providing both serialisations, DPV enables the adopters to choose the most suitable serialisation that supports their use-case and/or existing implementations, and retains semantic interoperability based on converting between SKOS and OWL2 (see <a href="https://www.w3.org/2006/07/SWD/SKOS/skos-and-owl/master.html">Using OWL and SKOS (2008)</a>).</p>    <div class="source" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre class='nohighlight'style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #3D7B7B; font-style: italic"># Example: A Company is running &#39;Direct Marketing&#39; campaigns for</span>

    <h3>Extending Concepts for Use-Cases</h3>
    <p>Most of the concepts within DPV are provided as hierarchies of classes representing categories of information, which are intentionally generic or abstract or broad so as to permit their application across a diverse and varied landscape of real-world use-cases. In order to accurately reflect the particulars of an use-case, concepts within DPV would (most likely) need to be extended. The specifics for how this should be done depend on the manner in which DPV is utilised. For example, using the default [[DPV]] specification which contains [[RDFS]] and [[SKOS]] semantics, extending is done by declaring a new concept an instance of the top concept using <code>rdf:type</code> and then using <code>skos:broader</code> to denote where it fits within the hierarchy. In [[DPV-OWL]] which uses [[OWL]] semantics, <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code> relationship is used to create hierarchy of sub-classes. Where an exact concept is not present within the DPV and a broader concept exists for representing the same information - one should subtype or extend that broad concept to define the required information.</p>
      <aside class="example" title="Extending concepts to represent use-case specific information">
<p>DPV defines the (broad) concept of <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#Marketing"><code>Marketing</code></a> in its <code>Purpose</code> hierarchy to represent information about (purposes related to) marketing activities and topics. For a use-case which requires representing purposes (note: plural) related to <i>marketing of new products</i>, the broad <code>Marketing</code> concept is extended as a <i>child</i> or <i>subclass</i> concept for representing the intended purpose as, e.g. <code>MarketingNewProducts</code>.</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Here the prefix <code>ex:</code> represents <code>http://example.com#</code> - which is a convention for representing additional examples or concepts, such as those created as part of the use-case. The rest of the document follows this nomenclature and convention.</p>    <div class="source" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre class='nohighlight'style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #3D7B7B; font-style: italic"># Example using DPV (RDFS+SKOS)</span>

    <p>The mechanism for extending concepts (via both subclasses/subtypes and instances) is useful to align existing concepts or vocabularies with the DPV taxonomies, such as by declaring them as subclasses of a particular concept. This permits the creation of domain or jurisdiction specific <i>extensions</i>, such as [[[EU-GDPR]]] for expressing the legal bases provided by GDPR. Extensions also permit more accurate representations of a use-case by extending from multiple concepts to refine and scope the interpretation. This means each concept can have multiple parents representing the intersection of their respective sets.</p>
      <aside class="example" title="Extending multiple concepts">
<p>For example, two TV companies (<code>AliceCo</code> and <code>BobCo</code>) extend the concept <code>Optimisation</code> to reflect their respective purposes. When exchanging information about their use-cases with each other (or with a third party), by following the chain of use-case specific concepts it is possible to deduce that both <code>AliceCo</code> and <code>BobCo</code> are doing optimisations for consumers. Thus a common language or interface can be developed based on using DPV as a point of interoperability and commonality which can be used by adopters to define the specifics of their use-case. For example, in the above use-case, a common notice generation algorithm could be created and used to inform users of both services the purposes each company is using data for.</p>    <div class="source" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre class='nohighlight'style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #3D7B7B; font-style: italic"># Example in DPV (RDFS+SKOS)</span>

<!-- TODO: order of operations description and examples -->

    <div class="note" title="Clarity on combining, extending, and instantiating concepts">
    <p>It is not necessary to extend concepts unless one wishes to depict use-case specific information. For example, if in a use-case it is sufficient to (only) say some information is collected, then <code>dpv:Collect</code> can be directly used. However, where more specific information is needed, such as also specifying a method of collection (e.g. <code>CollectViaWebForm</code>), then it is recommended to extend the concept, for example as <code>&lt;CollectViaWebForm a dpv:Collect&gt;</code>. If there are lots of forms and they need to be 'grouped' together as collection methods, then one would subtype/subclass <code>Collect</code> as <code>CollectViaWebForm</code> and create instances of it for each form to be represented.</p>
    <p>Though this example used a web form as a method of collection by directly mentioning it within the concept as <code>CollectViaWebForm</code>, this may not always be desirable. For example, that same web form may also need to be represented separately for logging purposes. DPV also provides the <code>DataSource</code> and <code>Technology</code> concepts for representing information regarding how concepts are implemented and the use of specific technological artefacts such as web forms, databases, along with their functions such as data storage and retrieval.</p>

  <section id="interoperability-of-concepts">
    <h3>Maintaining Interoperability</h3>
    <p>DPV intends to provide a core or foundational framework for different entities to exchange information and interpret concepts for interoperability. When an adopter (e.g. an organisation using DPV) extends concepts to refine them for their own use-case, the concept is still (weakly) interoperable by relying on DPV’s broad taxonomies to provide a common point of reference.</p>
      <aside class="example" title="Interoperability of extended concepts across use-cases">

<section id="extensions">
  <h2>Extensions</h2>
  <p>To supplement the concepts and taxonomies in [[DPV]] for specific applications, use-cases, or to provide separation for better management of terms, we provide several extensions to the DPV.</p>
  <section id="extension-pd">
    <h3>Personal Data (PD)</h3>
      <p>[[[PD]]] provides additional concepts that extend the DPV's personal data taxonomy based on an opinionated structure contributed by R. Jason Cronk from <a href="https://enterprivacy.com/">EnterPrivacy</a>. This separation is to enable adopters to decide whether the extension's concepts are useful to them, or to use other external vocabularies, or define their own.</p>
      <p>Concepts within [[PD]] are broadly structured in top-down fashion by utilising their relevance and origin as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Internal (within the person): e.g. Preferences, Knowledge, Beliefs</li>
        <li>External (visible to others): e.g. Behavioural, Demographics, Physical, Sexual, Identifying</li>
        <li>Household: e.g. personal or household activities</li>
        <li>Social: e.g. Family, Friends, Professional, Public Life, Communication</li>
        <li>Financial: e.g. Transactional, Ownership, Financial Account</li>
        <li>Tracking: e.g. Location, Device based, Contact</li>
        <li>Historical: e.g. Life History</li>
      </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="extension-loc">
    <h3>Locations (LOC)</h3>
    <p>[[[LOC]]] provides additional concepts regarding locations such as countries and regions based on the ISO 3166 standards. It enables representing information such as processing takes place within Ireland, represented by <code>loc:IE</code>, or within European Union (EU) by using <code>loc:EU</code>. We are working on expanding this list to also specify regions, cities, and other pertinent location details, and welcome participation and contributions for this.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="extension-risk">
    <h3>Risk Management (RISK)</h3>
    <p>[[[RISK]]] builds on top of the lightweight risk framework within DPV by providing the following extensive concepts related to risk assessment and management. We are in the process of identifying additional concepts and taxonomies for the risk extension, such as for risk management procedures and the creation of a risk ontology based on ISO standards.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Risk Controls</strong> - categories of measures such as those related to risk source, likelihood, consequence, vulnerability, as well as the intended effect in terms of monitoring, controlling, halting, removing, or reducing.</li>
      <li><strong>Consequences and Impacts</strong> - list of consequences such as data breaches, costs, identity theft and several others that are categorised based on DPV's impact framework i.e. damage, harm, or detriment.</li>
      <li><strong>Scale for Risk Levels, Severity, and Likelihood</strong> - a 7 point qualitative scale to express concepts associated with levels, severity, and likelihood of risk and its consequences.</li>
      <li><strong>Risk Matrix</strong> - an encoded form of risk matrices based on combinations of severity and likelihood along with the resulting risk level. Risk matrix nodes and values are provided for dimensions 3x3, 5x5, and 7x7.</li>
      <li><strong>Incidents, Reports, and Notices</strong> - specifying incidents such as security incidents or data breaches, documenting information about them, and notices used to communicate with other relevant entities such as authorities and data subjects.</li>
      <li><strong>Risk Management</strong> - risk management concepts based on ISO 31000 series.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="extension-tech">
    <h3>Technologies (TECH)</h3>
    <p>[[[TECH]]] extends the DPV's terms to represent further specific details regarding technologies, their management, and relevance to actual real-world tools and systems. It provides concepts for the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Provision method</strong>: System, Component, Algorithm, Service, Goods, Product, Subscription, Fixed Use</li>
      <li><strong>Communication method</strong>: WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS, Cellular Network</li>
      <li><strong>Actors</strong>: Developer, Provider, User, Subject, etc.</li>
      <li><strong>Intended Use</strong>: what the technology was/is intended to be used for</li>
      <li><strong>Documentation</strong>: technical and user manuals and other documentation</li>
      <li><strong>Status</strong>: whether the technology has been released, has been provided, and other statuses</li>
      <li><strong>Tools</strong>: databases, cookies, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The intention and aim of developing the TECH extension is to describe real-world tools and services, such as a specific cloud storage provider, and provide categorisation and metadata to connect it to DPV's concepts, such as to indicate the cloud storage instance features encryption at rest as a technical measure. Through these, the management and documentation of use-cases can be made easier by providing the relationships between tools/services and technical measures as a 'knowledge graph'.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="extension-ai">
    <h3>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3>
    <p>The [[[AI]]] extension provides concepts specifically regarding AI by extending the [[TECH]] extension. It consists of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Techniques</strong> such as machine learning and natural language programming</li>
      <li><strong>Capabilities</strong> such as image recognition and text generation</li>
      <li><strong>Lifecycle</strong> such as data collection, training, fine-tuning, etc.</li>
      <li><strong>Risks</strong> such as data poisoning, statistical noise and bias, etc.</li>
      <li><strong>Risk Measures</strong> to address the AI specific risks</li>
      <li><strong>Documentation</strong> such as Data Sheets and Model Cards</li>
      <li><strong>Data</strong> associated with AI development, training, validation, and use.</li>
      <li><strong>Systems and Models</strong> such as General Purpose, Robotics, Expert Systems.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="extension-justifications">
    <h3>Justifications</h3>
    <p>[[[JUSTIFICATIONS]]] provides concepts for use as 'justifications' with DPV. For example, where a right cannot be fulfilled, a justification such as 'identity could not be verified' is represented using a specific concept.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="extension-legal">
    <h3>Legal Concepts (LEGAL)</h3>
    <p>[[[LEGAL]]] provides concepts to represent laws, authorities, and other legal concepts in various jurisdictions. It is structured to create a separate namespace for each country or jurisdiction by using the ISO 3166-2 code, for example <code>IE</code> represents Ireland and <code>EU</code> represents the European Union. Within this namespace, the specific laws and authorities for that jurisdiction are defined.</p>
    <p>At the moment, the following jurisdictions are defined:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>[[LEGAL-EU]] representing (only) the European Union, with each Member State within the EU/EEA region being defined in its own separate namespace and extension to allow modelling both EU and Country-level laws and knowledge without conflicts:<ul>
        <li>[[LEGAL-AT]] for Austria</li>
        <li>[[LEGAL-BE]] for Belgium</li>
        <li>[[LEGAL-BG]] for Bulgaria</li>
        <li>[[LEGAL-CY]] for Cyprus</li>

  <section id="extension-sector">
    <h3>Sector</h3>
    <p>[[SECTOR]] provides extensions modelling specific sectors by using those sector-specific concepts, terms, and modelling which extends the concepts in other DPV extensions. At the moment, it only extends the Purpose taxonomy in [[DPV]]. In the future, we plan to provide more concepts such as Data and PersonalData categories.</p>
    <p>The following sectorial extensions are currently provided:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>[[SECTOR-EDUCATION]] for Education Sector</li>

  <section id="extension-standards">
    <h3>Standards</h3>
    <p>The STANDARD extensions model specific concepts and processes along with the terminology defined and used within specific standards. The goal of this is to represent concepts and processes defined in standards produced in forums such as ISO, CEN/CENELEC, NIST, and IEEE so that they can be used with DPV. It is not intended to duplicate the existing standards, especially when they are already provided as semantic web representations.</p>
    <p>The following standards are currently provided:</p>
