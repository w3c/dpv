  </figure>
  <p>DPV's taxonomy of tech/org measures are structured into four groups representing [=TechnicalMeasure=] such as encryption or de-identification which operate at a technical level, [=OrganisationalMeasure=] such as policies and training which operate at an organisational level, [=LegalMeasure=] which are organisational measures with legal enforcement such as contracts and NDAs, and [=PhysicalMeasure=] which are associated with physical aspects such as environmental protection and physical security. Each of these is provided with a taxonomy that expands upon the core idea to provide a rich list of measures that are intended to protect personal data and technologies (and its associated entities and consequences).</p>
  <p>To indicate applicability of measures, the relations [=hasTechnicalMeasure=], [=hasOrganisationalMeasure=], [=hasLegalMeasure=], and [=hasPhysicalMeasure=] are provided. In addition to these, specific relations are also provided for concepts commonly used or which are important for legal considerations - such as [=hasNotice=] and [=hasPolicy=].</p>

    <p>Technical measures refer to measures that are implemented at a technical level. They are represented by the concept [=TechnicalMeasure=] and are indicated using the relation [=hasTechnicalMeasure=]. Concepts provided to represent commonly used technical measures include [=AccessControlMethod=], [=AuthenticationProtocols=], [=AuthorisationProtocols=], [=CryptographicMethods=], [=DataBackupProtocols=], [=DigitalRightsManagement=], [=Encryption=], and [=SecurityMethod=].</p>
    <p>To express information about the technology implementing the technical measure, the concept `Technology` can be associated by using the relation `isImplementedUsingTechnology`. The [[TECH]] extension provides further concepts to represent technologies and their development and provision.</p>

  </figure>
  <p>Organisational Measures, represented by the concept [=OrganisationalMeasure=], are measures that are undertaken at an organisational level i.e. by the human involved within the organisation. They involve aspects such as performing assessments, consultations, establishing governance procedures, providing notices, contracts, policies, record keeping, and other similar activities. Though such activities can utilise technologies to support their implementations, the measure is still primary categorised as being associated with 'organisational activities'. Organisational measure are indicated by using the relation [=hasOrganisationalMeasure=].</p>
  {{ list_hierarchy(modules['TOM-organisational']['classes'], head='dpv:OrganisationalMeasure') }}
  {{ example_aside('dex:E0021') }}

</section>

  <section id="vocab-TOM-legal">
    <h2>Legal Measures</h2>
    <p>[=LegalMeasure=] represents organisational measures which have a legal enforcement mechanism or are legally defined/interpreted. For example, through contracts, NDAs, agreements. They are associated by using [=hasLegalMeasure=].</p>
    {{ list_hierarchy(modules['TOM-legal']['classes'], head='dpv:LegalMeasure') }}
  </section>

  <section id="vocab-TOM-physical">
    <h2>Physical Measures</h2>
    <p>[=PhysicalMeasure=] represents measures that have a physical implementation - such as physical access control or environment controls for floods, power outages, etc. They are associated by using [=hasPhysicalMeasure=].</p>
    {{ list_hierarchy(modules['TOM-physical']['classes'], head='dpv:PhysicalMeasure') }}
  </section>

  <section>
      <h3>Assessments</h3>
      <p>[=Assessment=] refers to a document, plan, or process for assessment or determination towards a purpose. For example, legal compliance assessment establishes compliance with the law and lawfulness. Similarly, privacy assessments concern privacy, risk assessments concern risks, and impact assessments concern impacts of operations and technologies. To represent such commonly utilised assessments, DPV provides the following concepts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>[=ComplianceAssessment=] and its extended concept [=LegalComplianceAssessment=] for compliance and legal compliance related assessments e.g. with a particular law</li>
        <li>[=ConformanceAssessment=] for assessment of conformance e.g. towards a standard or guideline</li>
        <li>[=DataInteroperabilityAssessment=] to assess the interoperability of data, such as that required by regulations like [[DGA]]</li>
        <li>[=DataQualityAssessment=] for assessment of data quality</li>
        <li>[=EffectivenessDeterminationProcedures=] for assessment of the effectiveness of other measures or activities</li>
        <li>[=LegitimateInterestAssessment=] to assess the legitimate interests used (as a legal basis) to justify the activity </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Assessments which refer to risks and/or impacts, such as risk assessment, privacy impact assessment, data protection impact assessment, and data breach impact assessment are defined in the 'risk' module within DPV due to their role within the risk management processes.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="vocab-TOM-notice">
      <h3>Notices</h3>
      <aside class="note" title="Guide on implementing consent records as per ISO/IEC 29184:2020">
        <p>The [[[DPV-29184]]] provides guidance on creation of privacy notices following the [[[ISO-29184]]] standard.</p>
      </aside>
      <aside class="issue" data-number="91"></aside>
      <p>The concept [=Notice=] represents a 'notice' which provides information and can be used to offer choices and make decisions - such as for privacy and consent. The relation [=hasNotice=] is used to indicate the inclusion or association of a notice within a context.</p>
      <p>The contents of a notice can be represented through other DPV concepts, for example a privacy notice can represent specific services and processes along with their purposes, personal data, and involved entities by utilising the relevant concepts and relations for these. Notices can also contain metadata, such as for their creation date, titles and descriptions, versions, and publisher information by utilising a common standard such as [[DCTERMS]].</p>
      {{ example_aside('dex:E0022') }}
      <section>
        <h4>Notice Types</h4>
        <p>DPV provides a taxonomy to represent the different notices commonly utilised in the context of data and technology use-cases. These include notices categorised by their role in providing information, such as [=PrivacyNotice=] and [=ConsentNotice=], and notices categorised by their UI/UX aspects, such as [=GraphicalNotice=], [=DashboardNotice=], and [=LayeredNotice=].</p>
        {{ list_hierarchy(modules['TOM-notice']['classes'], head='dpv:Notice') }}
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Notice Layer and Icons</h4>
        <p>For graphical notices that are composites of multiple 'layers' or utilise visual elements, the concepts [=NoticeLayer=] and [=NoticeIcon=] along with their corresponding relations [=hasNoticeLayer=] and [=hasNoticeIcon=] are useful to express to represent notices in terms of modular components.</p>
        {{ example_aside('dex:E0072') }}
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Notice Statuses</h4>
        <p>[=NoticeStatus=] represents a status about a [=Notice=], and is associated using the relation [=hasNoticeStatus=]. The DPV provides specific statuses modelling the lifecycle associated with notice provision and usage, such as [=NoticeCommunicated=] to indicate a notice has been provided, [=NoticeUpdated=] to indicate a notice has been updated, and [=NoticeLatest=] to indicate a notice is at its 'latest' iteration.</p>
        {{ list_hierarchy(modules['TOM-notice']['classes'], head='dpv:NoticeStatus') }}
        {{ example_aside('dex:E0073') }}
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Consent Notice</h4>
        <p>Requirements for <i>informed</i> consent require provision of information before the consent is obtained so as to inform the individual. This information is typically provided through a <i>notice</i>, which can be specified using the concept <code>ConsentNotice</code> and the relation <code>hasNotice</code>. As with the previous notice example, a consent notice can be a link to the actual notice document or web-page, or contain description of the notice contents regarding processing of personal data.</p>
        <aside class="note" title="Guide for implementing privacy notices for consent as per ISO/IEC 29184:2020">
        <p>We are working on providing a guide for implementing privacy notices for consent as per the ISO/IEC 29184:2020 standard. It will be provided as: [[[GUIDE-Notice-29184]]].</p>
      </aside>
        {{ example_aside('dex:E0017') }}
    </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Policies</h3>
      <p>[=Policy=] represents a guidance document outlining procedures, plans, principles, decisions, intent, or protocols. They are associated using the relation [=hasPolicy=].</p>
      <section>
      <h4>Data Processing Policies</h4>
        <p>DPV provides concepts to represent policies regarding:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>[=DataProcessingPolicy=] for specifying how data processing takes place - including [=DataDeletionPolicy=], [=DataErasurePolicy=], [=DataRestorationPolicy=], and [=DataStoragePolicy=].</li>
        <li>In addition to the above data related policies, DPV also defines [=DataJurisdictionPolicy=] to specify jurisdictional requirements, and [=DataReusePolicy=] for specifying how data can be further used for purposes other than its initial purpose.</li>
        <li>[=InformationSecurityPolicy=] regarding information security</li>
        <li>[=LoggingPolicy=] regarding logging of information (i.e. maintaining logs and records as a technical concept).</li>
        <li>[=MonitoringPolicy=] for how something should be monitored e.g. other policies and activities.</li>
        <li>[=RecertificationPolicy=] for how often or when certification should be renewed or checked for conformance.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="note" title="Privacy Policy vs Privacy Notice">
        <p>DPV does not provide the concept <i>PrivacyPolicy</i>, but instead suggests to use the better expressed and less ambiguous term - <code>PrivacyNotice</code>. This is to explicitly denote that the role of what is considered common as a "privacy policy" is actually a "notice" intended for end users and other individuals, instead of being an internal policy document for how the company should approach 'privacy'. More information about notices is provided in the next section.</p>
      </div>
      {{ example_aside('dex:E0055') }}
    </section>
    <section>
      <h4>Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)</h4>
      <p>The concept [=AcceptableUsePolicy=] represents a policy regarding what is considered as 'acceptable' in the sense that it is desired or can be allowed to happen or is permissible. By inference, things not covered by the policy are either not acceptable and should be avoided, or are not in the scope of what is considered acceptable.</p>
    </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Record Keeping</h3>
      <p>Records, or storing of information with the intention to use it in the future, are an important obligation for several legal as well as other obligations related to data protection and privacy. To support record keeping, the concept [=RecordsOfActivities=] is provided. Specific records are represented with the concepts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>[=DataBreachRecord=] for data breach records</li>
        <li>[=DataProcessingRecord=] for records about data processing activities, including [=ConsentRecord=], [=DataTransferRecord=], [=SecurityIncidentRecord=], and [=ROPA=] (Records of Processing Activities) - which is a specific document required by regulations such as GDPR.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="note" title="Records as documentation vs Records as processing operation">
        <p>DPV also contains the <code>Record</code> concept as a type of Processing operation, and <code>RecordManagement</code> as a type of Purpose. The former refers to recording of personal data as a means to obtain it (e.g. record a conversation), while the latter relates to the use of personal data towards creating records and managing them as a purpose (e.g. record consent was given). These are distinct, though relevant to the organisational measures related to record keeping.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Record keeping may require further vocabularies to represent details such as various temporal annotations, provenance, statuses, or other contextual information that is not possible or provided for by DPV's concepts. In such cases, we suggest utilising other standardised vocabularies where applicable.</p>
      
      <aside class="note" title="Guide on implementing Consent Records using DPV">
        <p>See the [[[GUIDE-Consent-27560]]] guidance on implementing consent records with DPV based on the ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023 technical specification.</p>
      </aside>

  <section id="tom-security">
      <h4>Security</h4>
      <p>All technical and organisational measures are intended, by definition, to provide better security and handling of personal data and its associated processing and other activities. In DPV's taxonomy, some measures directly and specifically relate to security as their topic, whilst others provide their intended benefit indirectly. For example, the concept <code>SecurityAssessment</code> is an organisational measure relating to how security is assessed (and thus ultimately improved) - and is directly associated with security as a topic. Whereas a concept such as <code>ProfessionalTraining</code> relates to measures that are not directly tied to security, but can be associated in cases where the training is related to security or specific security measures or risks (e.g. cybersecurity data breach mitigations). The purpose <code>EnforceSecurity</code> provides a common umbrella term for personal data that is utilised for enacting and enforcing security measures, such as for authorisation and authentication.</p>
      <p>Technical measures that relate specifically to security include <code>SecurityMethod</code> for providing security, and its subtypes for <code>DocumentSecurity</code>, <code>FileSystemSecurity</code>, <code>HardwareSecurityProtocols</code>, <code>IntrusionDetectionSystem</code>, <code>MobilePlatformSecurity</code>, <code>NetworkSecurityProtocols</code>, <code>OperatingSystemSecurity</code>, <code>WebBrowserSecurity</code>, <code>WebSecurityProtocols</code>, and more. Organisational measures that relate specifically to security include <code>SecurityProcedure</code>, and its subtypes for <code>BackgroundChecks</code>, <code>CybersecurityAssessment</code>, <code>CybersecurityTraining</code>, <code>SecurityAssessment</code>, and more.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="tom-agreements">
      <h4>Data Processing Agreements</h4>
      <p>The term <i>Data Processing Agreement</i> refers to a broad concept related to contracts or agreements between entities representing conditions regarding the processing of (personal-)data. This can include ad-hoc 'data handling' policies such as NDAs, embargoes, and enforcement of practices, as well as more formal and legal binding contractual obligations such as those between a Controller and a Processor.</p>
      <p>To represent such concepts, DPV provides <code>LegalAgreement</code>, along with subtypes for <code>NDA</code> (Non-disclosure agreements), <code>ContractualTerms</code>, and <code>DataProcessingAgreement</code>. In these, it is important to remember that while <i>contract</i> can also be as a form of legal basis, the concept represented here is not necessarily the same <i>contract</i> as that is used to justify the processing of personal data with a data subject. Instead, <i>contracts</i> are a broad category representing contractual terms governing data handling within or with an entity.</p>
      <p>For representing specific agreements between entities (other than those with data subjects - which are covered in Legal Basis taxonomy), DPV provides the following types of agreements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>ControllerProcessorAgreement</code>: An agreement between a Controller and a Processor, where the Controller instructs the Processor(s) to carry out processing on its behalf.</li>
        <li><code>JointDataControllersAgreement</code>: An agreement between two or more Controllers to act as a 'Joint Controller'.</li>
        <li><code>SubProcessorAgreement</code>: An agreement between two or more Processors where one Processor instructs another to carry out processing on its behalf.</li>
        <li><code>ThirdPartyAgreement</code>: An agreement between a Data Controller or a Data Processor, and a Third Party. Note that this is a loosely defined concept, as depending on the jurisdiction, this relationship may result in the Third Party being a Data Controller or a Joint Data Controller.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To indicate the entities involved in an agreement, the relation <code>hasEntity</code> can be used, or relations associated with specific roles to indicate contextuality. For example, using <code>hasDataController</code> with a <code>ControllerProcessorAgreement</code> denotes the Data Controller for that agreement.</p>
      {{ example_aside('dex:E0024') }}
    </section>

    <section id="tom-safeguard">
      <h4>Safeguards for Data Transfers</h4>
      <p>While all technical and organisational measures are intended to safeguard personal data and its associated activities, there may be contextual or use-case requirements to explicitly indicate safeguards against or for specific criteria. To enable such use, DPV provides the concept <code>Safeguard</code> and its subtype <code>SafeguardForDataTransfer</code> for indicating application when data is being transferred. Through these, it is possible to represent aspects such as policies for data transfers, specific measures such as encryption being applied, and other pertinent information in combination with DPV's concepts from technical and organisational measures.</p>
      {{ example_aside('dex:E0025') }}
      <aside class="note" title="GDPR's Data Transfer Tools">
        <p>[[GDPR]] and its various guidelines utilise the term "data transfer tools" to refer to specific measures that aid in safeguarding data transfers. Given this jurisdiction-specific nomenclature and its applicability being restricted to GDPR, DPVCG provides the concept <code>DataTransferTool</code> and its implementations (such as the SCCs above) within the [[EU-GDPR]] extension.</p>
