    <h2>Introduction</h2>

  </figure>
  <p>DPVâ€™s taxonomy of processing concepts reflects the variety of terms used to denote processing activities or operations involving personal data, such as those from [GDPR] Article.4-2 definition of processing. Real-world use of terms associated with processing rarely uses this same wording or terms, except in cases of specific domains and in legal documentation. On the other hand, common terms associated with processing are generally restricted to: collect, use, store, share, and delete.</p>
  <p>DPV provides a taxonomy that aligns both the legal terminologies such as those defined by GDPR with those commonly used. For this, concepts are organised based on whether they subsume other concepts, e.g. [=Use=] is a broad concept indicating data is used, which DPV extends to define specific processing concepts for [=Analyse=], [=Consult=], [=Profiling=], and [=Retrieve=]. Through this mechanism, whenever an use-case indicates it consults some data, it can be inferred that it also uses that data.</p>
  <p>For concepts related to expressing contextual information associated with processing, such as storage conditions, automation, scale, see <a href="#vocab-processing-context">Processing Context</a> and <a href="#vocab-processing-scale">Processing Scale</a> sections.</p>
  <div class="note" title="Need for ensuring accuracy of processing terms in an use-case">
      <p>The definitions for describing and interpreting each processing concept is based on the following sources: language dictionaries (predominantly Oxford English), use of the term within legal documents (e.g. GDPR case law), and technology-specific interpretations such as for IT systems. Despite these, there may be distinct interpretations for what a term represents based on differences in practices, culture, language, and domains. In case an adopter or a use-case foresees such ambiguity or confusion, it is advisable to extend the relevant concepts and define them as needed, or create a separate extension.</p>
    </div>
  {{ list_hierarchy(modules['processing']['classes']) }}
  <p>The 'unit of composition' in DPV is `dpv:Process`. Therefore it should be used to represent details about processing operations which are not directly describing the operation itself but are tangential or are disjoint from it - such as what data is being collected, why it is being collected (purpose). Details which describe the processing itself - such as what technology is being utilised or what entity is carrying it out - can be expressed as information about the processing. However, the suggested method is to always use a process where feasible as this supports the explicit depiction of information and allows composition i.e. the reuse of a process in a different context.</p>

<section id="processing-operations">
  <h2>Categories of Processing</h2>
  <section>
    <h3>Collect</h3>
    <p>[=Obtain=] is the broad concept representing various ways of obtaining or collecting data. [=Collect=] is a specific way of obtaining data, with other ways being to [=Derive=] or [=Infer=] it from existing data, or to [=Observe=] it. While it can be argued that [=Collect=] and [=Observe=] are the same method since observing data implies collecting data, the model here represents distinctions which become important in context. For example, to distinguish between data obtained from a person (collect) and data being detected through a signal (observe). Further [=Generate=] represents data being generated i.e. where it didn't exist before, whereas [=Derive=] and [=Infer=] have a link to some existing data which is used to produce the new data. Similarly, [=Acquire=] implies the data already exists elsewhere and is being 'acquired' in to the current context - for example by way of taking over a process or company.</p>
    <p>Most common uses of processing operations use the term 'collect' to represent all of the above, which can be misleading or ambiguous. Therefore, we suggest using the accurate verb to represent the processing operation accurately, or failing that, to use [=Obtain=] as the generic term. In particular, we caution again misappropriating [=Collect=] for [=Infer=] as there is an important distinction which is lost in context regarding the potential inaccuracy of inferred data which is a result of the method of inference. Data quality issues with collection can also be present, but represent a different category of 'errors' in operation. Further, inferences also have an important role when it comes to privacy matters - such as when inferencing sensitive or special categories of data which are not typically visible to the individual or source, whereas collection is explicit about the data being collected.</p>
    <p>Similarly, we also caution against mixing [=Derive=] which implies a derivation or transformation operation on existing information, such as a first name from a full name, with [=Infer=] where the intended output is not already present within the information. Sometimes these distinctions are not clear, or can involve ethical concerns which can vary from minor concerns such as inferring emotions from text to severe pseudo-scientific theories such as phrenology. Accurately depicting the processing operations is a key factor in carrying out risk and impact assessments as the risks associated with derived and inferred data are distinct and have different assessments and mitigations.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Store</h3>
    <p>[=Store=] represents the processing operation where data is stored i.e. preserved for later use. Merely stating [=Obtain=] does not imply that data is stored e.g. it could be collected, used, and then discarded. Therefore, whenever data is stored, we strongly suggest explicitly denoting [=Store=] as the processing operation. The processing operation [=Store=] does not distinguish the manner in which data is stored (e.g. as bytes, documents, images), nor the location of storage (e.g. on device, in cloud). These are all described through <a href="#storage-conditions">Storage Conditions</a>.</p>
    <p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Use</h3>
    <p>[=Use=] is a generic concept that represents data that has been obtained or is stored is being used to do something (which could be a purpose). There are specific forms of usage, such as [=Access=], [=Query=], and [=Retrieve=] which are technical operations, and [=Profiling=] and [=Tracking=] which are complex operations which involve additional concepts, but are expressed as processing operations to denote their nature as technical operations which by itself does not describe why they are taking place (i.e. the purpose).</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Transform</h3>
    <p>Operations where data is not being actively used (towards something) but is being technically organised or transformed is represented by [=Transform=] and its specific concepts. This includes [=Anonymise=] and [=Pseudonymise=], as well as [=Combine=] which includes other data. Transformations can happen as part of general data management, and do not by themselves necessarily imply they are being done towards a goal e.g. data is being aggregated and then later it is used by retrieving. This separation allows representing information about transformations in a granular manner without involving the use of this information (later) in various contexts.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Share</h3>
    <p>[=Disclose=] means to disclose the data (to someone or something). It is the generic concept for more specific forms of disclosure such as [=Display=], [=Export=], and the commonly used [=Share=]. We recommend using [=Disclose=] concepts to represent data being disclosed between entities, such as when showing the user some data, or sharing information with another entity. We also highlight the distinction between the use of [=Disclose=] and [=Transfer=] - where transfers simply means movement of data, whereas disclosure has an implication regarding crossing a boundary of an entity and may or may not involve a transfer.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Transfer</h3>
    <p>[=Transfer=] represents the technical notion of data movement from one location to another. Legally, this is an important concept where this movement happens between locations that cross a jurisdictional boundary. To represent this, we suggest using [=CrossBorderTransfer=]. Merely transferring data does not by itself imply concepts such as [=Share=] or [=Disclose=]. Therefore, to accurately and unambiguously express what processing operations are taking place, we recommend using [=Transfer=] with another concept where necessary.</p>
    <p>For [=CrossBorderTransfer=], it may be desirable to state the location or jurisdiction in question. This can be declared within the instance through `dpv:hasLocation` and `dpv:hasJurisdiction`. Note that we only recommend stating the location the data is being transferred to i.e. the target and not the current or source location, as that is the relevant information within a 'cross-border transfer'. The current location should be stated in its own context e.g. for [=Store=] or [=Obtain=] or [=Use=].</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Erase</h3>
    <p>[=Remove=] is the generic concept representing removal of data from the current context. This removal can be through [=Delete=] operations where data is logically removed - but where in theory it can be retrieved again (e.g. disk retrieval algorithms), or [=Erase=] where the data is removed in a way that retrieval is not possible (e.g. overwriting with null values). There is also [=Destruct=] which has a stronger implication of no recovery possible from any method - which can be used to describe aspects such as deletion of all copies of data from backups.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Tracking and Profiling</h3>
    <p>To indicate that the process involves profiling and tracking processing operations, the concepts [=Profiling=] and [=Tracking=] are provided. While profiling and tracking are more complex concepts as compared to collect or use or store as 'simple' operations, they are included in the processing operations taxonomy as they represent specific ways of using (personal) data, and by themselves do not provide sufficient indication of the <i>purpose</i> or intended objective for why they are being performed.</p>
    <p>[=Tracking=] is further distinguished as [=TrackingByFirstParty=] and [=TrackingByThirdParty=] to reflect the commonly used terms for tracking performed by entities considered as 'first' and 'third' parties within a context. While the DPV itself does not (yet) model these first/third relations, these concepts reflect existing uses of the term and therefore the DPV relies on these existing definitions and uses to guide the usage of these concepts. For reference, see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt/#terminology">Do Not Track terminology</a> page. Similarly, DPV's definition of [=Profiling=] is a minimal representation of creating a profile of a person based on the use of (some) data. To indicate specific definitions of profiling, e.g. in a law like the EU's GDPR, this concept should be extended to reflect the specific definition, such as the `eu-gdpr:Profiling` concept defined in the [[EU-GDPR]] extension based on the definition in GDPR's Article 4-4.</p>

    <h3>Processing Conditions</h3>

      <img src="../../diagrams/overview_Storage.svg">
      <figcaption>Overview of Processing and Storage conditions</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>To describe conditions associated with processing, such as its duration, or specific locations, the concept [=ProcessingCondition=] provided and extended as [=ProcessingDuration=] and [=ProcessingLocation=] along with the relation [=hasProcessingCondition=]. Storage, which is a specific form of processing, has additional dedicated concepts as [=StorageCondition=] as it is a commonly used concept. The concepts are useful to describe processing and storage conditions in  policies, conditions, rules, or documentation - which are important tools for implementing and determining data protection and privacy considerations as well as legal compliance.</p>
    {{ example_aside('dex:E0047') }}
    <p>The [[TECH]] extension provides relevant concepts to indicate technical aspects such as a server located in a specific location and provided by a cloud provider, which is being used to carry out the processing operations.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="storage-conditions">
    <h3>Storage Conditions</h3>
    <p>This taxonomy provides concepts for representing information about storage conditions, e.g. how long the data will be stored for, its erasure, or its restoration. It also enables representing the source(s) of data, the use of automation, and the extent of human involvement within the automation.</p>
    <p>The processing taxonomy uses the concept [=Store=] to indicate data is being stored. To specify additionally information such as its location, erasure or deletion, the generic concepts and relations associated with processing (i.e. <i>location</i> and <i>duration</i>) can be used. However, to emphasise that information about storage - such as policies, conditions, rules, or documentation - are critical on considerations of data protection and privacy as well as legal compliance, DPV provide specific concepts related to these.</p>
    <p>The concept [=StorageCondition=] and the relation [=hasStorageCondition=] represent the general or abstract conditions associated with storage of data. This is specialised to indicate [=StorageDuration=], [=StorageDeletion=], [=StorageRestoration=], and [=StorageLocation=]. This enables a document to directly specify information such as: "storage duration is 6 months" or "storage restoration uses 3 geo-distinct backup servers".</p>
    {{ example_aside('dex:E0048') }}
    <p>To indicate the use of cloud storage services, the [[TECH]] extension provides relevant concepts to represent the use of such cloud services as well as the actors involved to provide or develop them.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Data Source</h3>
    <figure>
      <img src="../../diagrams/Data_Source.svg">
      <figcaption>Data Sources defined in DPV</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>For declaring the source of data, the [=DataSource=] concept along with [=hasDataSource=] relationship is provided to indicate where the data is collected or acquired from. For example, data can be obtained from the data subject directly (e.g. given via forms) or indirectly (e.g observed from activity, or inferred from existing data), or from another entity such as a third party.</p>
    <div class="note" title="Source vs Origin">
        <p>It is important to understand the distinction between a <i>data source</i> and <i>data origin</i>. The source of data refers to the direct or indirect place, entity, or other concept from which the data was collected (in any manner). The origin of data refers to the specific entity or artefact which <i>produced</i> or <i>created</i> the data. For example, consider a company that collects data from a public database that is populated by government bodies who themselves collect that data from people. In this case, the origin of that data is ultimately the people, but the sources of this information are the people, the government bodies, and the public database.</p>
        <p>Using such two synonymous terms (source and origin) can lead to ambiguity and confusion. Therefore, we suggest using data source to indicate information as contextually required within a use-case. In most cases, this would be the direct source of data (i.e. public database in above example). In other cases, it would be relevant to indicating whether data originated from the data subject.</p>
      </div>
    <p>Data can be sourced from a public or a non-public source. The distinction is important given that a public source has different implications (and justifications) for the availability of that data as well as how it can be used. To represent these, DPV uses sub-types of data source as <code>PublicDataSource</code> and <code>NonPublicDataSource</code>. Public data sources can be datasets published by authoritative bodies, or census reports, or (public) websites. Non-public data sources are anything that is not publicly available - so data subjects, third parties, etc.</p>
    <p>The following data sources are defined within DPV:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>[=DataSubjectDataSource=] to indicate the data is sourced from Data Subject(s) e.g. when data is collected via a form or observed from their activities go to full definition</li>
      <li>[=DataControllerDataSource=] to indicate the data is sourced from Data Controller(s), e.g. a Controller inferring data or generating data go to full definition</li>
      <li>[=ThirdPartyDataSource=] to indicate the data is sourced from a Third Party, e.g. when data is collected from an entity that is neither the Controller nor the Data Subject </li>
    </ol>
    <p>In addition to these, the concepts [=PublicDataSource=] and [=NonPublicDataSource=] are also provided to indicate whether the data being sourced was publicly available or not.</p>
    </ol>

  <section>
    <h3>Entity Involvement</h3>
    <figure>
      <img src="../../diagrams/overview_Entity_Involvement.svg">
      <figcaption>Overview of Entity Involvement concepts in DPV</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
      <img src="../../diagrams/Entity_Involvement.svg">
      <figcaption>Permissive and Non-Permissive Involvement concepts in DPV</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>[=EntityInvolvement=] specifies how an entity is involved in terms of being permitted to do something, or not being permitted to do something. It contains two sets of correlated concepts as [=EntityPermissiveInvolvement=] for 'permissive' and [=EntityNonPermissiveInvolvement=] for 'non-permissive' involvements. For example, [=OptingOutFromProcess=] represents a 'permissive' involvement where the entity can opt-out, while [=CannotOptOutFromProcess=] is its 'non-permissive' counterpart which indicates the entity cannot opt-out. Other concepts provided concern challenging the process and its inputs and outputs, correcting the process and its inputs and outputs, reversing the process' effects and its inputs and outputs, and withdrawing from a process.</p>
    <p>In addition to the above involvements, two additional concepts provided are: [=EntityActiveInvolvement=] and [=EntityPassiveInvolvement=] to represent whether the involvement of an entity can be considered 'active' or 'passive'. Here, the term 'active' means the entity actively engages with the processing or system or technology, and 'passive' means it does not. For example, a person filling a web form to enter their data has an active involvement, whereas a person being monitored via a CCTV has a passive involvement. Note that here the terms 'active/passive' do not represent or concern the 'awareness' or 'comprehension' of the entity, and only represent the involvement in terms of operating or using or being subjected to the system or process. The concept `EntityInformedStatus` should be used to represent whether the entity is informed or not.</p>
    <p>To represent how humans are involved, the concept [=HumanInvolvement=] and relation [=hasHumanInvolvement=] are provided. Human involvement is broadly specified in terms of [=HumanInvolved=] and [=HumanNotInvolved=]. Where humans are involved, additional concepts such as [=HumanInvolvementForDecision=] or [=HumanInvolvementForInput=] provide a clear representation of the involvement. Terms such as 'human-in-the-loop' were discussed and not used due to their unclear definitions and non-compatible uses across documents. Instead, the DPV defined concepts provide unambiguous representation of how humans are involved, and can be mapped to definitions of such terms within specific use-cases.</p>

    <h3>Automation Level and Human Involvement</h3>
    <figure>
      <img src="../../diagrams/Automation_Human_Involvement.svg">
      <figcaption></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <div class="note" title="Automation and Artificial Intelligence">
      <p>DPV's concepts intentionally refer to "<i>automation</i>" rather than "<i>artificial intelligence</i>", where the former is considered a broader and more inclusive term than the latter. It also avoids delving into investigations of what is and how to define "AI". Given that AI is a form of automation, whether directly or indirectly applied, these terms within the DPV are also intended to supplement use-cases where AI is used, and to represent information regarding the degree of automation and involvement of humans within its processes.</p>
    </div>
    <p>DPV defines concepts to specify the 'level of automation' and 'human involvement' in processing operations. These are in addition to entity involvement so as to specifically indicate how humans are involved in the automated operations.</p>
    <p>[=AutomationLevel=] describes the level of automation associated with processing operations. It is based on the levels defined by [[[ISO-22989]]], which consist of [=NotAutomated=] (level 0) where no automation is involved, to [=FullAutomation=] (level 5) representing automation without human involvement, and [=Autonomous=] (level 6) representing automation which can modify its operational goals without human intervention. Automation levels are specified by using the relation [=hasAutomationLevel=].</p>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h3>Decision Making and its Logic</h3>
    <p>To indicate more specific applications: [=DecisionMaking=] and [=AutomatedDecisionMaking=] refer to use of processing to make decisions, [=AlgorithmicLogic=] for explaining the use of algorithms and specifics of processing logic, [=EvaluationScoring=] to indicate the processing evaluates or assigns scores (or metrics), [=InnovativeUseOfNewTechnologies=] to indicate there are innovative uses of novel technologies, and [=SystematicMonitoring=] to indicate the processing performs a systematic (or systemic) monitoring. These additional concepts are intended to model areas or topics that are considered sensitive or high-risk or require caution.</p>

  <section id="vocab-processing-scale">
    <h2>Scale of Processing</h2>
    <figure>
      <img src="../../diagrams/Processing_Scale.svg">
      <figcaption>Overview of Processing Scale concepts in DPV</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>DPV provides the (qualitative) concept [=Scale=], with further specialisations for expressing [=DataVolume=], [=DataSubjectScale=], and [=GeographicCoverage=] related to activities. Along with these, DPV also provides a [=ProcessingScale=] to express combinations of these (e.g. [=LargeScaleProcessing=]). The relation [=hasScale=] is used to indicate the scale, with specific relations [=hasDataVolume=], [=hasDataSubjectScale=], [=hasGeographicCoverage=], and [=hasProcessingScale=] to indicate the different types of scales.</p>
    <aside class="note" title="Scales are qualitative and require additional information to be used quantitatively">
      <p>DPV's concepts for 'Scale' are qualitative attributes used within the particular domain or context. The actual meaning or quantified amounts for each scale are not defined due to their interpretation based on contextual factors such as legislation, guidelines, domains, and variations across industries. To indicate these, the relevant scale concept should be extended along with information (e.g. `rdf:value`) or description (e.g. `dct:description`) of the quantitative value of the scale.</p>
    </aside>
    <p>[=DataVolume=] refers to the volume of data. Concepts provided to represent this range from [=SingularDataVolume=] as the least/smallest to [=LargeDataVolume=] and then [=HugeDataVolume=] as the most/greatest. The relation [=hasDataVolume=] is used to indicate the volume of data.</p>
    <p>[=GeographicCoverage=] represents the scale in terms of geographic coverage - which can be used to indicate the spread of processing operations, or to indicate diversity of data subjects in terms of locations, or to indicate other location based scales. The concepts provided range from [=LocalEnvironmentScale=] to represent 'local environment' (e.g. a room, a device) to [=GlobalScale=] to represent operations at a global scale. The relation [=hasGeographicCoverage=] is used to indicate the geographic coverage.</p>
    <p>[=DataSubjectScale=] represents the scale of data subjects, which can be regarding the amount of data subjects represented within some data, or those involved in processing operations, or other similar representations. Provided concepts range from: [=SingularScaleOfDataSubjects=] as the least/smallest to [=LargeScaleOfDataSubjects=] and then [=HugeScaleOfDataSubjects=] as the most/largest. The relation [=hasDataSubjectScale=] is used to indicate the scale of data subjects.</p>
    <p>[=ProcessingScale=] represents the 'scale of processing' which is useful to indicate scales not covered by the other provided concepts or to indicate their abstraction e.g. to provide a qualified term for whether processing is 'large scale' in terms of one or more factors. It is extended to define [=SmallScaleProcessing=], [=MediumScaleProcessing=], and [=LargeScaleProcessing=], and is indicated by using the relation `hasScale`.</p>
