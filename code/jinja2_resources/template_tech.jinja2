  <section id="abstract">
    <p>The [[[DPV]]] provides the concept <i>Technology</i> to represent how technologies are applied within the context of personal data and its processing. The TECH extension provides further specific details regarding technologies, their management, and relevance to actual real-world tools and systems. The namespace for terms in tech is <a href="http://w3id.org/dpv/tech#"><code>https://w3id.org/dpv/tech#</code></a>. The suggested prefix for the namespace is <code>tech</code>. The TECH vocabulary and its documentation is available on <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv">GitHub</a>.</p>

  <section id="vocab-actors">
    <h2>Actors involved in Technologies</h2>
    <p>To specify the specific actors and their roles in the context of technologies, the concept [=Actor=] is provided along with the relation [=hasActor=] to associate it with the technology. Further specific actors and their associations are defined by extending these concepts, for example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>[=Developer=] and [=hasDeveloper=] specifies who develops or has developed the technology.</li>
      <li>[=Provider=] and [=hasProvider=] specifies who provides the technology. This could be the same entity as developer, or a different one - such as when the technology is repackaged or modified before provision.</li>
      <li>[=User=] and [=hasUser=] specifies who uses or is the user for the technology.</li>
      <aside class="note" title="Technology User does not refer to end-user">   <p>The term <i>User</i> refers to users in the technical sense of the term, where such users may or may not be <i>data subjects</i> or end-users or other similar concepts. For example, a technology used by an immigration officer has that officer as the user, rather than the immigrating person. To be more explicit, <i>technology user</i> and <i>whom the technology is used on</i> are two different criterias. See [=Subject=] concept to represent the immigrating person in this scenario. In other cases, both the user and subject can be the same person, for example where a person is using a technology on their personal device to take a selfie.</p>
      </aside>
      <li>[=Subject=] and [=hasSubject=] is the <i>subject</i> of the technology i.e. whom the technology is used on or subjected to. This may be directly (e.g. person within a CCTV camera's vision) or indirectly (e.g. person whose details were used as training data). What is considered a subject may be contextually dependant on the nature and scope of the technology as well as its application. In the future, we may separate this concept for further distinction between direct and indirect subjects (or use alternate terms) - if such categorisation is deemed beneficial in the description of individuals subjected to technologies.</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="note" title="Technology actors defined in regulations">
      <p>Technology actors are defined in regulations such as [[[AIAct]]] and [[[NIS2]]] - which have specific criterias and conditions present in the definition and role of such actors. The [[TECH]] extension takes these regulations as the basis to develop its concepts but provides a generic vocabulary that can be used across jurisdictions and in any-case. To specifically represent an actor as defined within a regulation, the appropriate extension should be used - for example the [[EU-AIAct]] extension for [[AIAct]] which contains concepts such as AI Provider and AI Developer as defined in the regulation.</p>

    <aside class="example" title="Indicating actors involved in technologies">
      <p>This example illustrates the use of TECH extension to indicate various actors associated with technologies. It illustrates the 'value chain' perspective where various entities can be involved from developing to using the technology.</p>

  <section id="vocab-intended-use">
    <h2>Intended Use</h2>
    <aside class="note" title="Why 'Intended Use' is needed instead of reusing 'Purpose'">
      <p>Technology is developed and used with a specific purpose or goal in mind - such as to verify identity, or collect specific data, or send information packets over a networking connection. It is important to distinguish such 'purposes' associated with technology from the similar named term 'purpose' in [[DPV]]. The DPV term <code>Purpose</code> refers to the end-goal and a sufficiently clear description for why the personal data is being processed or the technology is being used. If we use the same concept to indicate the purpose of technologies as described earlier, it would 'pollute' the DPV's purpose taxonomy with other non-purpose concepts such as store data (processing), networking encryption (technical measure), and so on. To avoid this, the TECH extension recommends NOT using the purpose concept directly with technology.</p>
    </aside>
    <p>To indicate the uses for which a technology is developed, or what it is planned to be used for, the TECH extension provides the concept [=IntendedUse=] and which is associated with using the relation [=hasIntendedUse=]. The 'intended use' of technology represents uses which an actor envisions the technology to be used for. This could be the developer who envisions specific uses of the technology while developing it, or a user who plans to use the technology for specific activities when they acquire it. Such intended uses can be represented by using concepts within the DPV and its extensions - such as purposes, processing operations, technical and organisational measures, and so on. Where the intended use cannot be represented by a single concept, multiple concepts can be combined by using the relations in a manner similar to the use of <code>dpv:Process</code>.</p>
    <aside class="example" title="Indicating the intended uses of technologies">
      <p>This example indicates the intended use of technology by directly reusing an existing DPV concept (<code>ex:1</code>), and by combining multiple concepts together (<code>ex:2</code>).</p>
      <pre class="nohighlight"><code>ex:1 a dpv:Technology ;
  tech:hasIntendedUse dpv:Collect, dpv:Store ;
  rdfs:comment "Technology intended to collect and store data"@en .

ex:2 a dpv:Technology ;
  tech:hasIntendedUse [
    a tech:IntendedUse ;
    dpv:hasPersonalData pd:EmailAddress ;
    dpv:hasPurpose dpv:Marketing ;
    dpv:hasProcessing dpv:Collect, dpv:Store, dpv:Use ;
    dpv:hasUser dpv:Employee ;
    rdfs:comment "Technology intended to send makreting emails by employee"@en ;
  ] .
      </code></pre>
    </aside>
    <p>Intended Use is an intent or ex-ante indication or plan for the use of technology. The <i>actual use</i> of the technology should be represented within the context of a process instance. Where there is a difference between the intended and actual use, whether such differences are classified as 'misuses' or 'violations' depends on the context. For example if the technology has the intended use to send emails for account communications, and the actual use involved using the technology for sending newsletters, then the difference between intended and actual use may be classified as 'misuse' or it may lead to realising that the earlier intended use did not sufficiently represent all required uses of the technology, and lead to updating the intended uses. Thus, in practice, a technology may have several intended uses that evolve over time.</p>
    <aside class="example" title="Intended and actual uses of technologies">
      <p>The following example demonstrates the distinction between intended and actual uses of technologies. The intended use is indicated as a plan or ex-ante process, and the actual use is indicated by associating the technology directly in context of a process. It also demonstrates the ability to directly create an instance of <code>IntendedUse</code> and associate it with multiple technologies by using <code>dpv:hasTechnology</code>. In the example, the intended use of the technologies is represented to be account management, whereas the actual use also involves identity authentication. By comparing the intended with the actual use, it is possible to evaluate whether there are any misuses of the technology or whether the intended uses are incomplete. To enable such uses, it is important to represent the intended and actual uses of technologies in a clear and non-ambigious manner.</p>

    <h2>Provision of Technology</h2>
    <p>The provision of technology can happen via the following methods:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>[=System=], [=Component=], and [=Algorithmic=] - that indicate whether the technology is provided as a system (e.g. stand alone), is intended to be used as a component in another system, or is algorithmic (e.g. implementation of a particular method).</li>
      <li>[=Service=], [=Goods=], [=Product=], and [=Subscription=] - that provide an indication of whether the technology is service (e.g. implemented to function as a service), or is a product or a subscription (e.g. provided by a vendor). In this, [=Service=] is extended to represent various kinds of [=CloudService=] such as Platform-as-a-Service ([=PaaS=]) and Software-as-a-Service ([=SaaS=])</li>
      <li>[=FixedUse=] indicates whether the technology has limitations of use e.g. specific number of application or single application, or those related to scale or scope. For example, a single use identifier or a one time scan for vulnerabilities.</li>

    <aside class="example" title="Enhancing the TECH tools taxonomy">
      <p>We welcome contributions and discussions on further refining and expanding the TECH tools taxonomy to support practical uses of technologies in use-cases. In this, we suggest carefully choosing the terms to be added to ensure they fit the DPV taxonomies, and to avoid taking any 'marketing' terms that have no basis in law or standards. For cases where there are a large number of terms which do not fit well within the DPV taxonomies, we are open to creation of specific extensions to represent them. For example, a cloud services extension which represents the exact terms used by providers, and which is mapped to DPV TECH taxonomy.</p>
