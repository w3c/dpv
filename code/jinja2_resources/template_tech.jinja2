  <section id="abstract">
    <p>The [[[DPV]]] provides the concept <i>Technology</i> to represent how technologies are applied within the context of personal data and its processing. The TECH extension provides further specific details regarding technologies, their management, and relevance to actual real-world tools and systems. The namespace for terms in tech is <a href="http://w3id.org/dpv/tech#"><code>https://w3id.org/dpv/tech#</code></a>. The suggested prefix for the namespace is <code>tech</code>. The TECH vocabulary and its documentation is available on <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv">GitHub</a>.</p>

  <section id="vocab-actors">
    <h2>Actors involved in Technologies</h2>
    <p>To specify the specific actors and their roles in the context of technologies, the concept [=Actor=] is provided along with the relation [=hasActor=] to associate it with the technology. Further specific actors and their associations are defined by extending these concepts, for example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>[=Developer=] and [=hasDeveloper=] specifies who develops or has developed the technology.</li>
      <li>[=Provider=] and [=hasProvider=] specifies who provides the technology. This could be the same entity as developer, or a different one - such as when the technology is repackaged or modified before provision.</li>
      <li>[=User=] and [=hasUser=] specifies who uses or is the user for the technology.</li>
      <aside class="note" title="Technology User does not refer to end-user"><p>The term <i>User</i> refers to users in the technical sense of the term, where such users may or may not be <i>data subjects</i> or end-users or other similar concepts. For example, a technology used by an immigration officer has that officer as the user, rather than the immigrating person. To be more explicit, <i>technology user</i> and <i>whom the technology is used on</i> are two different criteria. See [=Subject=] concept to represent the immigrating person in this scenario. In other cases, both the user and subject can be the same person, for example where a person is using a technology on their personal device to take a selfie.</p>
      </aside>
      <li>[=Subject=] and [=hasSubject=] is the <i>subject</i> of the technology i.e. whom the technology is used on or subjected to. When humans are subjects, we recommend explicitly stating this using `dpv:HumanSubject` and `dpv:hasHumanSubject`. Subjects can be involved directly (e.g. person within a CCTV camera's vision) or indirectly (e.g. person whose details were used as training data). What is considered a subject may be contextually dependant on the nature and scope of the technology as well as its application. The [[DPV]] provides concepts to represent whether an entity (including humans) are involved in an 'active' or 'passive' capacity as well as other forms of involvement - which is useful in the description of individuals subjected to technologies.</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="note" title="Technology actors defined in regulations">
      <p>Technology actors are defined in regulations such as [[[AIAct]]] and [[[NIS2]]] - which have specific criteria and conditions present in the definition and role of such actors. The [[TECH]] extension takes these regulations as the basis to develop its concepts but provides a generic vocabulary that can be used across jurisdictions and in any-case. To specifically represent an actor as defined within a regulation, the appropriate extension should be used - for example the [[EU-AIAct]] extension for [[AIAct]] which contains concepts such as AI Provider and AI Developer as defined in the regulation.</p>
    </aside>
    <aside class="example" title="Indicating actors involved in technologies">
      <p>This example illustrates the use of TECH extension to indicate various actors associated with technologies. It illustrates the 'value chain' perspective where various entities can be involved from developing to using the technology.</p>

    <h2>Function &amp; Intended Use</h2>
    <aside class="note" title="Why not reuse 'dpv:Purpose'? Why do we need 'Function' and 'Intended Use'?">
      <p>Technology is developed and used with a specific <i>purpose or goal</i> in mind - such as to verify identity, or collect specific data, or send information packets over a networking connection. It is important to distinguish such 'abstract <i>purposes</i>' associated with technology from the similarly named term <code>Purpose</code> in [[DPV]] which refers only to the end-goal and a sufficiently clear description for the technology within a specified context.</p>
      <p>If we reuse the '<i>purpose</i>' term to also describe how technologies are developed or used towards what are essentially more technical terms (e.g. data collection, networking), it would 'pollute' the DPV's purpose taxonomy by increasing its scope to such an extent that it subsumes the other concepts and taxonomies - such as processing actions (e.g. collect or use data), technical measures (e.g. encryption), or context (e.g. human involvement).</p>
      <p>To avoid this issue, and to ensure the Purpose taxonomy stays useful, the TECH extension uses [=Function=] and [=IntendedUse=] to express the intended information without any semantic conflict with other existing concepts.</p>
    </aside>
    <p>[=Function=] is a generic abstract term that refers to what '<i>functions</i>' a technology has or is capable of through the relation [=hasFunction=]. It can be used as a 'catch-all' concept to express that a technology is capable of e.g. identity verification (purpose), data collection (processing operation), access control or encryption (technical measure), and other concepts. A function in a technology is always present or possible with the use of that technology, and a specific use-case may or may not use the function. It thus provides a way to express information about the technology regarding what exists or can be done without invoking any potential interpretation that the technology is being used in a specific way. Function as a concept is not necessary to be used until the other existing DPV concepts, which are more concrete and specific, are not sufficient for reasons described above.</p>
    <aside class="example" title="Indicating the functions available in a technology from what is being used">
      <p>A company procures a database technology that has several functions such as data storage, data retrieval, encryption, access control, networking, and so on - but only a few of these are being used in a specific use-case. To distinguish what the technology can do from what 'features' or 'functions' being used in the use-case, the Function concept comes in handy. In the below example, the technology has several functions available, of which a specific process uses only some to collect and store data in an encrypted form.</p>
      <pre class="nohighlight"><code>ex:DatabaseProduct a dpv:Database ;
      dpv:hasFunction 
        dpv:Collect, dpv:Store, dpv:Retrieve, # Processing
        dpv:AccessControlMethod, dpv:Encryption, # Technical Measure
        tech:Networking . # Communication Mechanism 

ex:SpecificProcess a dpv:Process ;
  dpv:hasPersonalData pd:Name ;
  dpv:hasPurpose dpv:IdentityVerification ;
  dpv:hasProcessing dpv:Collect, dpv:Store ;
  dpv:hasTechnicalMeasure dpv:Encryption ;
  dpv:isImplementedUsingTechnology ex:DatabaseProduct .
      </code></pre>
    </aside>
    <p>[=IntendedUse=] is useful to indicate the uses for which a technology is developed, or what it is planned to be used for, and which is associated with a technology through the relation [=hasIntendedUse=]. The 'intended use' could be the developer who envisions specific uses of the technology while developing it, or a user who plans to use the technology for specific activities when they acquire it. Such intended uses can be represented by using concepts within the DPV and its extensions - such as purposes, processing operations, technical and organisational measures, and so on. Where the intended use cannot be represented by a single concept, multiple concepts can be combined by using the relations in a manner similar to the use of <code>dpv:Process</code>.</p>
    <aside class="example" title="Indicating the intended uses of technologies">
      <p>This example indicates the intended use of technology by directly reusing an existing DPV concept (<code>ex:1</code>), and by combining multiple concepts together (<code>ex:2</code>).</p>
      <pre class="nohighlight"><code>ex:1 a dpv:Technology ;
  tech:hasIntendedUse dpv:Collect, dpv:Store ;
  rdfs:comment "Technology intended to collect and store data"@en .

ex:2 a dpv:Technology ;

    dpv:hasUser dpv:Employee ;
    rdfs:comment "Technology intended to send marketing emails by employee"@en ;
  ] .
      </code></pre>
    </aside>
    <p>Intended Use is an intent or ex-ante indication or plan for the use of technology. The <i>actual use</i> of the technology should be represented within the context of a process instance. Where there is a difference between the intended and actual use, whether such differences are classified as 'misuses' or 'violations' depends on the context. For example if the technology has the intended use to send emails for account communications, and the actual use involved using the technology for sending newsletters, then the difference between intended and actual use may be classified as 'misuse' or it may lead to realising that the earlier intended use did not sufficiently represent all required uses of the technology, and lead to updating the intended uses. Thus, in practice, a technology may have several intended uses that evolve over time.</p>
    <aside class="example" title="Intended and actual uses of technologies">
      <p>The following example demonstrates the distinction between intended and actual uses of technologies. The intended use is indicated as a plan or ex-ante process, and the actual use is indicated by associating the technology directly in context of a process. It also demonstrates the ability to directly create an instance of <code>IntendedUse</code> and associate it with multiple technologies by using <code>dpv:isImplementedUsingTechnology</code>. In the example, the intended use of the technologies is represented to be account management, whereas the actual use also involves identity authentication. By comparing the intended with the actual use, it is possible to evaluate whether there are any misuses of the technology or whether the intended uses are incomplete. To enable such uses, it is important to represent the intended and actual uses of technologies in a clear and non-ambiguous manner.</p>
      <pre class="nohighlight"><code>ex:TechPlan1 a tech:IntendedUse ;
  dpv:isImplementedUsingTechnology ex:MyDatabase, ex:MyCloudServer ;

    <h2>Provision of Technology</h2>
    <aside class="note" title="Breaking change introduced in v2.1">
      <p>The Technology Provision concepts were renamed in v2.1 by adding the prefix <code>ProvidedAs</code> to better indicate their role as provision methods, and to avoid ambiguity with the technology itself. For example, <code>System</code> in v2.0 represented a technology provided as a system, which in v2.1 has been renamed to <code>ProvidedAsSystem</code> to avoid misinterpretation of <i>System</i> as only referring to the way a technology is provided as compared to it being used distinctly as a 'system' or as a 'component'.</p>
    </aside>
    <p>The provision of technology can happen via the following methods:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>[=ProvidedAsSystem=], [=ProvidedAsComponent=], and [=ProvidedAsAlgorithmic=] - that indicate whether the technology is provided as a system (e.g. stand alone), is intended to be used as a component in another system, or is algorithmic (e.g. implementation of a particular method).</li>
      <li>[=ProvidedAsService=], [=ProvidedAsGoods=], [=ProvidedAsProduct=], and [=ProvidedAsSubscription=] - that provide an indication of whether the technology is service (e.g. implemented to function as a service), or is a product or a subscription (e.g. provided by a vendor). In this, [=ProvidedAsService=] is extended to represent various kinds of [=ProvidedAsCloudService=] such as Platform-as-a-Service ([=ProvidedAsPaaS=]) and Software-as-a-Service ([=ProvidedAsSaaS=])</li>
      <li>[=ProvidedAsFixedUse=] indicates whether the technology has limitations of use e.g. specific number of application or single application, or those related to scale or scope. For example, a single use identifier or a one time scan for vulnerabilities.</li>
      </ul>
      <aside class="example" title="Indicating a technology is provided as a SaaS subscription">

  <section id="vocab-operations">
    <h2>Operating Factor/Environment</h2>
    <p>The concept [=OperatingFactor=] allows specifying which 'factors' can potentially affect the operation or performance of the technology. These factors could be parts of the technology itself, inputs to it such as data or beans fed into a coffee machine, or even environmental conditions such as lighting for camera operations or the setup of the operating system for a software. Operating Factors are associated using the relation [=hasOperatingFactor=]. The association of such factors allows indicating how the operations of the technology will change based on factors, and further distinguishing them as 'idea', 'unsuitable', or 'problematic' based on context.</p>
    <p>[=OperatingEnvironment=] represents the environment within which the technology operates. This could be a physical location such as a description of an enclosed room where specific operational factors such as lighting condition and humidity levels (or ranges) can be associated. It could also be a virtual location such as a specific operating system with specific software libraries and applications installed or the existence of internet connectivity could be specified as operational factors. Operating Environment is associated using the relation [=hasOperatingEnvironment=]. Specifying the operating environment allows documenting where and how the technology operates, and assists in further assessments of security, quality, and safety management.</p>
    <p>Both operating factors and environments are also useful as concepts to indicate intended uses of technology in more granular details. For example, technology can be specified to be operated safely only in specific environments and where factors are within a specific range. Environments and factors outside of this configuration are either indicated as unsafe, or are required to be assessed as being safe before deployment.</p>

      <p>We welcome contributions and discussions on further refining and expanding the TECH tools taxonomy to support practical uses of technologies in use-cases. In this, we suggest carefully choosing the terms to be added to ensure they fit the DPV taxonomies, and to avoid taking any 'marketing' terms that have no basis in law or standards. For cases where there are a large number of terms which do not fit well within the DPV taxonomies, we are open to creation of specific extensions to represent them. For example, a cloud services extension which represents the exact terms used by providers, and which is mapped to DPV TECH taxonomy.</p>
