    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <figcaption></figcaption>
  </figure>
    <p>DPV provides the concept [=Rule=] to specify requirements, constraints, and other forms of 'rules' that are associated with specific contexts (e.g., processing activities) using the relation [=hasRule=]. DPV provides two categories of rules to broadly represent what is <i>acceptable</i> ([=AcceptableRule=]) and <i>unacceptable</i> ([=UnacceptableRule=]). DPV also provides concepts to indicate the outcome of assessing the rules as statuses through [=RuleFulfilmentStatus=] with distinction between [=RuleFulfilled=], [=RuleUnfulfilled=], and [=RuleViolated=].</p>

    <p>DPV does not define additional semantics for rules and limits its scope and focus to provide a simple way to specify permissions, prohibitions, and obligations as common rules associated with activities, as well as recommendations and deterrence in assessments and guidelines. For a more extensive and richer set of semantics and concepts to represent rules, DPVCG suggests looking towards other languages, such as [[ODRL]], [[SHACL]], and [[RuleML]] that have been developed with the specific goal of representing and applying rules. We welcome contributions for aligning DPV with these, and for providing guidance on how to complement DPV's rule-based concepts with external languages.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="vocab-rules">
    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <p>DPV's Rules are broadly categorised as [=AcceptableRule=] to indicate something is desired and can or should be allowed to happen - including the undesirability of it not occurring, and [=UnacceptableRule=] to indicate the opposite i.e. something that is undesirable to occur or it is desirable for it to not occur. These categories are only indicative as a way to group the specific concepts together based on commonality of interpretation and application.</p>

    <section id="vocab-rules-rfc2199">
      <h3>Alignment with RFC2199</h3>
      <p>The rules concepts are based on specific phrasing defined in [[[RFC2199]]] that allows a standardised and consistent interpretation of the rules and provides a way to detect and represent them in textual forms and documentation. The table below summarises this association.</p>

    <section id="vocab-rules-permission">
      <h3>Permission</h3>
      <p>[=Permission=] refers to the indicated context being allowed or approved to be carried out. Permissions are only a 'permissive signal' i.e. it is not necessary to carry out an activity just because it is permitted (see obligation for this). Permissions can be used to record what has been permitted, such as in use-cases for policies, agreements, consent records, and risk assessments. [=Permission=] is indicated/associated using the relation [=hasPermission=], and is typically indicated in textual form through the [[RFC2199]] keyword MAY.</p>
      <p>A [=Permission=] means an optional acceptability, where the default or expectation is that something is not occurring and it is <i>permissible</i> to let is occur. Thus, when evaluating permissions, the only possible outcomes are whether it has or has not been utilised (see the <a href="#vocab-rules-fulfilment">fulfilment statuses</a>).</p>

      {{ example_aside('dex:E0028') }}
    </section>

    <section id="vocab-rules-recommendation">
      <h3>Recommendation</h3>
      <p>[=Recommendation=] refers to the indicated context being suggested to be carried out. Recommendations are only a 'suggestion' i.e. it is not necessary (see obligation) to carry out an activity, but as it is being <i>recommended</i> not carrying out, it should be accompanied with a justification (see {{anchor('dpv:Justification')}} that explains why it was not carried out. Recommendations can be used to record what has identified as the 'default' to occur with the possibility that it may not be desirable or may not occur in some cases. Such uses are typical in policies and guidelines. [=Recommendation=] is indicated/associated using the relation [=hasRecommendation=], and is typically indicated in textual form through the [[RFC2199]] keyword SHOULD.</p>
      <p>A [=Recommendation=] means a desired acceptability, where the default or expectation is that it is <i>permissible</i> to let is occur and it should be occurring. Thus, when evaluating recommendations, the only possible outcomes are whether it has or has not been utilised (see the <a href="#vocab-rules-fulfilment">fulfilment statuses</a>).</p>
    </section>

    <section id="vocab-rules-obligation">
      <h3>Obligation</h3>
      <p>[=Obligation=] refers to the indicated context being necessary or mandatory to be carried out. Obligations are a 'requirement' i.e. it is necessary to carry out an activity, which implies it is permitted, and that not carrying it out will be a problem or issue or violation. Obligations can be used to issue requirements in use-cases for policies, agreements, consent records, and risk assessments. [=Obligation=] is indicated/associated using the relation [=hasObligation=], and is typically indicated in textual form through the [[RFC2199]] keyword MUST.</p>
      <p>A [=Obligation=] means a necessary acceptability, where the default or expectation is that something is occurring and it is <i>necessary</i> to let is occur. Thus, when evaluating obligations, the only possible outcomes are whether it has been fulfilled (i.e. what was said has been carried out), unfulfilled (i.e. not carried out but there is scope to so), and violated (see the <a href="#vocab-rules-fulfilment">fulfilment statuses</a>).</p>
    </section>

    <section id="vocab-rules-prohibition">
      <h3>Prohibition</h3>
      <p>[=Prohibition=] refers to the indicated context being necessary or mandatory to NOT be carried out. Prohibitions are a 'requirement' i.e. it is necessary to NOT carry out an activity, which implies it is not permitted, and that carrying it out will be a problem or issue or violation. Prohibitions can be used to issue requirements that are different from obligations in that the implementer must ensure the prohibited part is not being carried out, whereas obligations require that part to be carried out. [=Prohibition=] is indicated/associated using the relation [=hasProhibition=], and is typically indicated in textual form through the [[RFC2199]] keyword MUST NOT.</p>
      <p>A [=Prohibition=] means a necessary unacceptability, where the default or expectation is that something is not occurring and it is <i>prohibited</i> to let is occur. Thus, when evaluating prohibitions, the only possible outcomes are whether it has been fulfilled (i.e. what was said has NOT been carried out) or violated (see the <a href="#vocab-rules-fulfilment">fulfilment statuses</a>).</p>
    </section>

    <section id="vocab-rules-deterrence">
      <h3>Deterrence</h3>
      <p>[=Deterrence=] refers to the indicated context being suggested to NOT be carried out. Deterrences are only a 'suggestion' i.e. it is not necessary (see prohibition) to prevent an activity, but as it is being <i>deterred</i> from being carrying out, it should be accompanied with a justification (see {{anchor('dpv:Justification')}} that explains why it was carried out. Deterrences can be used to record what has identified as the 'default' that should not be occurring with the possibility that it may be desirable or may occur in some cases. Such uses are typical in policies and guidelines. [=Deterrence=] is indicated/associated using the relation [=hasDeterrence=], and is typically indicated in textual form through the [[RFC2199]] keyword SHOULD NOT.</p>
      <p>A [=Deterrence=] means a desired unacceptability, where the default or expectation is that it is <i>not permissible</i> to let is occur and it should be not occurring. Thus, when evaluating recommendations, the only possible outcomes are whether it has or has not been utilised (see the <a href="#vocab-rules-fulfilment">fulfilment statuses</a>).</p>
    </section>

    <section id="vocab-rules-indication">
      <h3>Indicating Rules</h3>
      <p>Rules can be expressed in two forms: (1) by directly declaring them as an instance of a specific rule concept; and (2) by using the relation to declare an interpretation/application of a rule. The example below shows both in use, where the first method uses a relation to indicate whether a process is permitted or prohibited, and the second contains the process itself being declared as permitted or prohibited.</p>
      {{ example_aside('dex:E0066') }}
      <p>Both methods have their advantages or utility. For Method 1 where relations are used, this allows existing processes to be contextually declared as permitted in one use-case and prohibited in another. For Method 2 where instances are used, this allows annotating processes or use-cases as being permitted or prohibited in entirely -- e.g. in reports. A note of caution: though Method 1 uses relations, it can be inferred that the process is being permitted/prohibited when running a reasoner (which is correct in context).</p>
      <!-- dct:source can be used to indicate the source of the permission or prohibition e.g. prohibited by GDPR Art-9-1 -->

    <section id="vocab-rules-fulfilment">
      <h2>Rule Fulfilment Status</h2>
      <p>The DPVCG is exploring representing the state of rule fulfilment through concepts, for example to represent a prohibition has been violated, or an obligation has been fulfilled, or a permission has been utilised. The currently provided concepts for these, represented by the concept [=RuleFulfilmentStatus=] and its taxonomy, which are associated using the relation [=hasFulfilmentStatus=], indicate the intent and scope of this work.</p>
      {{ list_hierarchy(modules['rules']['classes'], head='dpv:RuleFulfilmentStatus') }}
      {{ example_aside('dex:E0084') }}
      <p>The DPVCG is working with ongoing efforts regarding similar modelling of concepts for ODRL implementations, in particular to ensure the concepts in DPV are in sync and compatible with those developed for ODRL. The below issue shows the progress for this.</p>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Interpreting Rules</h2>
    <aside class="issue" data-number="189"></aside>
    <section>
      <h3>Default Interpretation</h3>
      <p>Though DPV provides concepts representing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontic_logic">deontic logic</a>, it does not specify what should be the 'default' interpretation in relation to rules, i.e. it does not provide an interpretation of whether some rules apply automatically unless otherwise declared. For example, in declaring an instance of Process, the assumption is that the activities are modelled for what is happening or what is intended/planned to happen. The explicit annotation using a Permission rule adds information about whether some activity is permitted (and its associated information). Instead, if the use-case is using DPV to only document activities that are permitted, there is no need to explicitly specify the permissions. Similarly, just because something is happening or planned to happen, it cannot be assumed to be permitted (e.g. pending evaluation of legal requirements). </p>
      <p>This lack of default interpretation enables modularity in the use of DPV concepts. For example, an instance of `dpv:Process` which does not have a `dpv:hasRule` declared within it, can be made part of a rule to specify permissions, prohibitions, or obligations regarding the process. If instead the process had a default interpretation (e.g. permission), then it would require creating a separate instance with the same information - leading to duplicated efforts. While an apparent solution is to create a mechanism whereby the rule in the process is overridden with the intended 'outer' rule or context e.g. to specify the prohibition in one process overrules permission in another process, this prevents the combination of rules to describe situations such as a permission for a larger context within which specific parts are prohibited or obligated.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Mixing/Nesting Rules</h3>
      <p>In representing Rules, DPV only provides the concept and does not express any inherent semantics on what those rules mean in relation to each other. For example, DPV does not express Permission to be non-compatible or disjoint from Prohibition. This is to separate the interpretation and application of rules based on the necessities of a use-case. For example, in a legal investigation it may be prudent to specify permission and prohibition can never occur together, but this may not be true if there are different legal requirements that allow a prohibition to be resolved or deferred, such as through another permission that overrides the prohibition.</p>
      <p>Further, as described earlier in the section on default interpretations, it is possible to mix or nest rules such as through processes. For example, if `ProcessA` is a permitted process and contains `ProcessB` which is a prohibited process, DPV does not dictate what should be default interpretation for this arrangement. The role of DPV concepts regarding rules, as of now, is to provide a simplified indication of whether something is permitted, prohibited, or obligated. Further interpretations require creation of a formal specification that dictates how rules should function together. For example, depending on the use-case, several interpretations are possible for the example described here:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><i>Prohibitive interpretation:</i> Both `ProcessA` and `ProcessB` are prohibited because through `ProcessA` is permitted, `ProcessB` is within it and is prohibited - thereby prohibiting both processes. Such interpretations prevent modularity - everything is prohibited because something is prohibited, or it is permitted because there are no prohibitions.</li>
        <li><i>Permissive interpretation:</i> `ProcessA` and `ProcessB` are both permitted since `ProcessA` gives permission for the entire process and overrides the prohibition in `ProcessB`. Such interpretations also prevent modularity - everything is permitted because the higher/broader processes are permitted even though there are specific prohibitions at a granular level.</li>
        <li><i>Contextually Prohibitive interpretation:</i> `ProcessB` is prohibited as declared, and the rest of `ProcessA` without `ProcessB` is permitted. If there was a further `ProcessC` that is permitted, and is present within `ProcessB`, then `ProcessC` would still be prohibited as the broader prohibition from `ProcessB` overrides it. Such interpretations permit modularity with permission granted for parts as long as there is no prohibition overriding it from a broader context. In this, a prohibition within a permission still allows the permitted parts to be carried out, whereas a permission within a prohibition would still be prohibited.</li>
        <li><i>Contextually Permissive interpretation:</i> This is the same as the contextually prohibitive interpretation, except permissions occurring within prohibitions are not overridden. This means, `ProcessA` is allowed through its permission, with `ProcessB` within it being prohibited, except for `ProcessC` within `ProcessB` - which is permitted.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The above example interpretations only concerned permissions and prohibitions, and did not include obligations - or other concepts such as duties, dispensations, exceptions, and defeasibility. From this, it should be clear how the specification and interpretation of rules can be quite complex and has a large impact on the intended activities and information being documented.</p>
      <aside class="note" title="DPVCG is exploring providing rule interpretation concepts in future versions">
        <p>The DPVCG is discussing the provision of concepts to indicate the interpretation of rules as discussed above. These concepts would then be associated with rules to express how they should be interpreted - which would avoid ambiguities and ensure consistent interpretation through shared semantics.</p>
        <p>In addition, we are also interested in representing concepts for conflict resolution strategies - for example what should be done if an permission and a prohibition are expressed over the same resource. Like the interpretation concepts, the conflict resolution concepts would also be expressed along with the rules to ensure all implementations have a consistent interpretation and outcome regarding the rules.</p>
        <p>As with the Rules Fulfilment concepts, this work is expected to be in sync with the ODRL implementation work. We welcome ideas and participation in this process. See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/189">Issue#189</a>.</p>

    </section>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Triggering Rules</h2>
    <p>DPV does not define how rules are 'triggered' i.e. how to specify under what conditions a rule should become applicable or is exempted from being applied. Some common triggers for rules to be applied are provided here as examples:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><i>Ex-ante:</i> the rule is applied <u>before</u> the specified activity is carried out.</li>
      <li><i>Ex-post:</i> the rule is applied <u>after</u> the specified activity is carried out.</li>
      <li><i>Real-time:</i> the rule is applied <u>during</u> the specified activity being carried out.</li>
    </ol>
    <aside class="note" title="DPVCG is exploring providing rule trigger concepts in future versions">
      <p>The rule trigger concepts would represent when/how the rule is to be applied - as described above - and would further assist in explicitly representing the intended interpretation and application of a rule within the stated context. For example, whether an obligation associated with a process is to be carried out before the process starts (ex-ante trigger) or after it completes (ex-post trigger) would be interpreted through these concepts. In addition to these, further granular concepts would also assist in further expressing the intended actions - such as a prohibition that comes in to play only on failures of a process to complete successfully, or an obligation that only occurs if a process is successful.</p>
    </aside>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Alignment with ODRL</h2>
    <p>[[ODRL]] provides a W3C standardised representation for expressing policies containing rules such as for permissions, prohibitions, obligations over 'assets' and the involved 'parties'. While ODRL focuses on providing a general structure for policies without jurisdictional concepts or modelling, it complements DPV by enabling declaration of policies, agreements, and other similar documents in a structured, interoperable, and standardised manner. The DPV concepts enable specifying the exact information within the structure provided by ODRL - which can be useful for two entities to exchange information. For example, in a controller-processor agreement, ODRL can be used to define the agreement in terms of involved parties, their roles, and which entity is responsible for performing which actions, as well as the expected ex-post consequences of those actions - such as for reporting from processor to controller, or to indicate what should be done should a particular requirement is violated.</p>
    <p>The DPVCG is interested in formally authorising a shared specification with the ODRL Community Group that outlines the use of DPV concepts for/with ODRL. The current proposal for this is to create an ODRL profile that declares DPV concepts in context of ODRL's conceptual model and through which DPV concepts can be correctly declared and used in ODRL. The current draft guidance document for use of DPV and ODRL is available at [[[GUIDE-ODRL]]], and the mapping of concepts between DPV and ODRL is available at [[[MAPPING-ODRL]]].</p>
