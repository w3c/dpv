    <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <figure>
    <img src="../../diagrams/rights.svg">
    <figcaption></figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>The concept [=Right=] represents a normative concept for what is permissible or necessary in accordance with a system such as laws. To associate rights with concepts that are relevant or within which those rights occur, the relation [=hasRight=] is used. Rights can be <i>passive</i>, which means they are always applicable without requiring anything to be done, or <i>active</i> where they require some action to be taken to initiate or exercise them. To represent these concepts, DPV uses [=PassiveRight=] and [=ActiveRight=] respectively. Rights can be applicable to different contexts or entities. To differentiate rights applicable or afforded to data subjects, the concept [=DataSubjectRight=] is used.</p>

  {{ example_aside('dex:E0067') }}
  </section>

  <section>
  <h2>Rights Notices</h2>
  <p>The information provided regarding a right is called a 'Rights Notice'. It may be used to describe which rights exist, when they are applicable, how to exercise them, and other pertinent details. As with other notices in DPV, a rights notice is associated by using the `dpv:hasNotice` relation. The concept [=RightExerciseNotice=] represents specifically notices associated with exercising of rights - such as to indicate where and how to exercise it (expressed using [=isExercisedAt=] relation), or what information is required for the exercise, or to provide updates on an exercised rights request. For expressing contextual information, other existing concepts should be reused e.g. {{anchor('dpv:Process')}} to group related information together into a 'process', with {{anchor('dpv:hasPurpose')}} and {{anchor('dpv:IdentityVerification')}} to indicate the right exercise will involve identity verification.</p>
  <p>To indicate information about whether a rights exercise has been fulfilled or cannot be fulfilled - such as when additional information is needed, the concepts [=RightFulfilmentNotice=] and [=RightNonFulfilmentNotice=] are provided.</p>
  {{ example_aside('dex:E0061') }}
  </section>

  <section>
  <h2>Rights Exercise</h2>
  <p>A [=RightExerciseActivity=] represents a concrete instance of a right being exercised. It can include contextual information such as timestamps, durations, entities, etc. that can be part of record-keeping. An activity can be a single <i>step</i> related to rights exercise -- such as the initial request to exercise that right, or its acknowledgement, or the final step taken to fulfil the right (e.g. provide some information), or it can also be a single activity describing the entire rights exercise process(es). To collate related activities associated with a rights exercise (e.g. associated with a specific data subject or a specific request), the concept [=RightExerciseRecord=] is useful.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
  <h2>Rights Records</h2>
  <p>To indicate contextual information about Right Exercise activities, DPV suggests reuse of existing relations, such as those from DPV itself and [[[DCT]]]. For example, <code>dct:accessRights</code> can be used to specify constraints or requirements regarding access (e.g. log in required), or <code>dct:hasPart</code> and <code>dct:isPartOf</code> to express records and its contents, <code>dct:valid</code> to express validity constraints on the exercising being made available, <code>foaf:page</code> to specify the location or provision of notice, and {{anchor('dpv:hasStatus')}} with {{anchor('dpv:RequestStatus')}} to represent the status of a rights exercise activity.</p>
  <p>When rights require the provision of information which beyond a static common notice, for example a document personalised to the individual's information, or a dataset containing the individual's data, DPV recommends using [[[DCAT]]] to model the contents as a <code>dcat:Resource</code> or other relevant concepts from [[DCAT]] and [[DCT]] such as <code>dct:format</code>, <code>dct:accessRights</code>, and <code>dct:valid</code>.</p>

    <p>DPV uses the following terms from [[RDF]] and [[RDFS]] with their defined meanings:</p>
    <ul>
      <li id="rdf:type"><dfn>rdf:type</dfn> to denote a concept is an instance of another concept</li>
      <li id="rdfs:Class"><dfn>rdfs:Class</dfn> to denote a concept is a Class or a category</li>
      <li id="rdfs:subClassOf"><dfn>rdfs:subClassOf</dfn> to specify the concept is a subclass (subtype, sub-category, subset) of another concept</li>
      <li id="rdf:Property"><dfn>rdf:Property</dfn> to denote a concept is a property or a relation</li>

    <p>The following external concepts are re-used within DPV:</p>
