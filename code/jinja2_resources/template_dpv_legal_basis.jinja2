    <figcaption>Legal Bases in DPV</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>DPV provides the following categories of legal bases based on [[GDPR]] Article 6: consent of the data subject, contract, compliance with legal obligation, protecting vital interests of individuals, legitimate interests, public interest, and official authorities. Though derived from GDPR, these concepts can be applied for other jurisdictions and general use-cases. The legal bases are represented by the concept [=LegalBasis=] and associated using the relation [=hasLegalBasis=].</p>

  <p>When declaring a legal basis, it is important to denote under what law or jurisdiction that legal basis applies. For instance, using {{anchor('dpv:Consent')}} as a legal basis has different obligations and requirements in EU (i.e. [[GDPR]]) as compared to other jurisdictions. Therefore, unless the information is to be implicitly interpreted through some specific legal lens or jurisdictional law, DPV recommends indicating the specific law or legal clause associated with the legal basis so as to scope its interpretation. This can be done using the relation {{anchor('dpv:hasJurisdiction')}} or {{anchor('dpv:hasApplicableLaw')}}. The list of available laws and their representation as extensions in DPV can be seen in the [[LEGAL]] extension.</p>
  
  {{ list_hierarchy(modules['legal_basis']['classes']) }}
  <div class="note"><p>When using legal bases, we advise careful consideration whether the information to be represented is regarding a specific instance (e.g. consent of a specific individual) or a general category (e.g. contract with service consumer/users), and to utilise DPV concepts accordingly.</p></div>

  <section id="vocab-legal-basis-contract">
    <h2>Contract</h2>
    <p>The concept [=Contract=] represents a legal contract, which can be used as a legal basis through the [=hasLegalBasis=] relation to justify data processing or use of technologies. [=Contract=] as a legal basis covers activities associated with creation of the contract ([=EnterIntoContract=]) and the performance of the contract [=ContractPerformance=]. Metadata associated with the contract such as date, time, subject, etc. can be represented using [[[DCT]]].</p>
    <p>Contracts are also a `dpv:LegalMeasure` that can be used by organisations to enforce obligations e.g. by a controller on a processor. Similarly, contracts can also be 'agreements' e.g. between a controller and a processor, where the processor uses this agreement as a legal basis to process personal data.</p>

    <section id="vocab-legal-basis-contract-metadata">
      <h3>Contract Metadata</h3>
      <p>Metadata about the contract is suggested to be expressed using the following properties based on [[DCTERMS]]:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>dct:title</code> - Indicates title of contract</li>
      <li><code>dct:conformsTo</code> - Indicates a standard or specification to which the contract conforms to e.g. a technical specification outlining which fields are present in the contract or a legal requirement or a standard for expressing contracts</li>
      <li><code>dct:created</code> - Indicates date of contract creation. Date of creation is not the same as date of enforcement or when the contract becomes 'active', and only refers to when a contract was completed in terms of its drafting</li>
      <li><code>dct:issued</code> - Indicates when the contract was issued or given to a party</li>
      <li><code>dct:creator</code> - Indicates entity that created or drafted the contract. Creator refers to the entity that was responsible for determining the contents of the contract. For standard form contracts, only the parties involved in determining the terms and conditions should be listed as creators. In a negotiated contract, all parties will be listed as creators</li>
      <li><code>dct:modified</code> - Indicates the date when the contract was modified e.g. as part of the negotiation process</li>
      <li><code>dct:dateAccepted</code> - Indicates date when contract was accepted all parties. All parties may not accept the contract at the same date, in which case the date of the last party accepting the contract should be used</li>
      <li><code>dct:hasPart</code> - Associates a contract with a contractual part. A contractual part can contain clauses or other elements and is a useful abstraction to create modular resources that can be independently used or reused across contracts</li>
      <li><code>dpv:hasIdentifier</code> - Indicates the legally relevant identifier of the contract. Legally relevant here refers to an identifier that is relevant to legal obligations and investigations e.g. tax identifiers shared with the tax office. For other identifiers, use dct:identifier</li>
      <li><code>dct:language</code> - Indicates the language used in the contract</li>
      <li><code>dct:provenance</code> - Indicates the provenance of the contract e.g. previous versions in a negotiation process. The [[PROV-O]] ontology can be useful to represent provenance information associated with activities and artefacts</li>
      <li><code>dct:subject</code> - Indicates the subject of the contract. The subject can be the description used in the contract as to its main topic or subject. To indicate specifics such as service, purpose, or technology - the relevant DPV concepts should be used</li>
      <li><code>dpv:hasDuration</code> - Indicates the duration for validity of the contract</li>
      <li><code>dpv:hasEntity</code> - Indicates a party to the contract. If the party has a specific role in the contract, e.g. Controller, Data Subject, Service Provider/Consumer - then the relevant DPV concept and property should be used instead</li>

      <h3>Contract Types</h3>
      <p>Contract types represent the vocabulary of contract types which reflects the way contracts are defined and interpreted towards specific purposes. For example, [=DataProcessingAgreement=] represents contract concepts typically used for processes involving (personal) data, [=ContractByEntityType=] represents contracts such as B2B (Business-to-Business), B2C (Business-to-Consumer), etc., and [=ContractByDomain=] represent contracts with specific interpretations such as for licensing agreements and employment.</p>

        <figcaption>State diagram representing how contract states are interpreted and defined in DPV. The individual boxes or section represent a collection of states that represent a specific aspect of the contract lifecycle. The red arrows represent transition between these states. The multiple start symbols represent only representing the states from that stage onward.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>To represent the status associated with a contract, the concept [=ContractStatus=] and the relation [=hasContractStatus=] are provided. A taxonomy of statuses representing the lifecycle of contract formation and use is provided, for example [=ContractDrafted=] to indicate the completion of contract drafting process, [=ContractUnderNegotiation=] to indicate the contents of the contract are being negotiated and that the contract is being accepted/signed by involved parties, [=ContractFullySigned=] indicating all parties have signed the contract, and [=ContractTerminated=] indicating the contract has been terminated.</p>
      <p>[=ContractFulfilmentStatus=] represents the status associated with fulfilment of a contract in terms of its requirements and obligations. It is associated using the relation [=hasContractualFulfilmentStatus=]. Specific fulfilment states are provided, for example [=ContractFulfiled=] indicating all requirements of the contract have been fulfilled, [=ContractBreached=] indicating a breach of contract, and [=ContractNotFulfiled=] indicating the requirements have not been fulfilled (but it isn't a breach yet e.g. there is still time/opportunity to complete them).</p>

The relation [=hasContractControl=] is used to associate the control with a contract or clause. Controls can be used to indicate where specific actions can be taken, for example to indicate that accepting a contract can be done by sending a request or visiting the stated URL, or to express specific requirements which must be satisfied before the action can be completed, for example to state termination of a contract occurs over a duration.</p>

    </figure>
    <p><code>Consent</code> is an important legal basis given its emphasis on individual empowerment and control, as well as the attention and relevance it receives from being part of direct interactions with individuals. Consent in DPV is a specific legal basis representing <i>information associated with consent</i> rather than only <i>given consent</i>. Common information associated with consent includes tasks such as keeping track of whether "consent has been given/obtained", "issuing a consent request", and "withdrawing consent", as well as expressing requirements through terms such as "informed" and "explicit". DPV provides concepts for representing information about how consent, as a legal basis, is utilised (by the Controller), provided or given (by the Data Subject), how long it is considered to be valid (its duration), and how it can be withdrawn. It also provides concepts related to management of information, such as keeping track of whether the consent has been requested, was refused, or has been given. This information can be utilised in applications associated with consent, such as creating a ‘record’ of consent or building and executing rules for compliance.</p>
    <p><p>Given the reliance of consent as a legal basis whose validity is associated with requirements and obligations based on jurisdictional laws, DPV does not explicitly provide constraints on what should be considered a ‘valid’ consent. Instead, it focuses on providing declaration of information about consent so as to aid in the determination of its validity, and to record its use and changes over time. Further information concerning compliance obligations and requirements related to consent are considered within the scope of the DPVCG, and we welcome contributions on how this can be represented in a coherent manner that is compatible with the rest of DPV.</p>
    <p>To assist with representing these concepts as well as keeping records about how they are being applied, DPV provides the following consent concepts.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>[=Consent=] - a type of legal basis representing consent of the individual.</li>
      <li><a href="#vocab-legal-basis-consent-types">Consent Types</a> - to represent criteria for consent, such as [=InformedConsent=] and [=ExplicitlyExpressedConsent=].</li>
      <li><a href="#vocab-legal-basis-consent-status">Consent Status</a> - to represent and keep track of what state/status/stage the consenting process is at, for example indicating the journey or lifecycle from [=ConsentRequested=] to [=ConsentGiven=] and then [=ConsentWithdrawn=].</li>
      <li><a href="#vocab-legal-basis-consent-controls">Consent Controls</a> - to indicate information about how to obtain or provide or reaffirm consent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To indicate the duration or validity of a given consent instance, the existing contextual relation `dpv:hasDuration` along with specific forms of `dpv:Duration` can be used. For example, to indicate consent is valid until a specific event such as account closure, the duration subtype `dpv:UntilEventDuration` can be used with additional instantiation or annotation to indicate more details about the event (in this case the closure of account). Similarly, `dpv:UntilTimeDuration` indicates validity until a specific time instance or timestamp (e.g. 31 December 2022), and `dpv:TemporalDuration` indicates a relative time duration (e.g. 6 months). To indicate validity without an end condition, `dpv:EndlessDuration` can be used. To indicate the notice used for informed consent, the concept `dpv:ConsentNotice` is provided, which can be used with the relation `dpv:hasNotice`.</p>
    <p>To specify consent provided by delegation, such as in the case of a parent or guardian providing consent for/with a child, the `dpv:isIndicatedBy` relation can be used to associate the parent or guardian responsible for providing consent (or its affirmation). Since by default the consent is presumed to be provided by the individual, when such individuals are associated with their consent, i.e. through `dpv:hasDataSubject`, the additional information provided by `dpv:isIndicatedBy` can be considered redundant and is often omitted.</p>

    <section id="vocab-legal-basis-consent-types">
      <h4>Consent Types</h4>
      <p>By default, consent is expected to adhere to several requirements such as being informed, freely given, and so on - typically defined within law or other relevant guidelines, that determine how it is requested, expressed, and evaluated for validity. In DPV, these are referred to as <i>types of consent</i>.</p>
       <p>DPV provides <code>InformedConsent</code> and <code>UninformedConsent</code> as two distinct concepts related to whether the consent is informed or not. For more types of informed consent, the concept <code>ImpliedConsent</code> specifies when consent is indirectly expressed or is assumed, and <code>ExpressedConsent</code> for when the individual specifically takes an action to (only) express their consent. The difference between the two can be better understood as follows: if the individual performs an action, and that action only relates to consent, then it is said to be <i>expressed consent</i>, whereas if that action also relates to other matters in addition to being about consent, then the interaction is said to be <i>implied (form of) consent</i>. Clicking a button on a consent notice is a direct action and is thus a form of expressed consent. Assuming consent based on continued scrolling of a web page is an indirect or assumed action, and is thus implied consent.</p>
       <div class="note" title="Implied Consent in DPV is not the same as Medical Implied Consent">
          <p>In medical terminology, "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implied_consent#Medical_care"><i>implied consent</i></a>" is an assumption that the person's consent is present so as to avoid the restrictions of collecting consent prior to any (emergency)treatment. This is not the case with privacy and data protection perspectives, where 'implied consent', no matter how well intentioned the purpose may be, should not be considered 'assumed' without any specific action.</p>
          <p>Therefore, we welcome well reasoned arguments and concrete proposals to express other types of consent, including justifications for where concepts such as <code>AssumedConsent</code> may be useful and have a basis in a law or other authoritative source.</p>
        </div>
      <p>When the expressed action for consent only (and only) refers to matters related to consent, then such consent is represented by <code>ExplicitlyExpressedConsent</code>. For example, if a button for expressing consent relates to conveying decisions about consent, but also other things such as to navigate to the next page, then this is a clear and specific action for expressing consent. However, if such a button only relates to indicating consent, then it is <i>explicitly about consent</i>, and is thus an instance of <i>Explicitly Expressed Consent</i>.</p>
      <div class="note" title="Explicit consent in DPV, ISO, and GDPR">
        <p>The term <i>explicit consent</i> is present in both ISO as well as GDPR and other laws. However, definitions differ significantly and are incompatible with each other. For example, what ISO considers 'explicit' would be 'expressed' (or regular) under GDPR. The approach taken by DPV is intentional towards enabling such variations to be expressed in specific extensions by building on top of the core vocabulary concepts. For example, the [[EU-GDPR]] extension defines <code>A6-1-a-explicit-consent</code> and <code>A9-2-a</code> as subtypes of <code>ExplicitlyExpressedConsent</code> based on the specific requirements and criteria defined by GDPR.</p>

    <section id="vocab-legal-basis-consent-status">
      <h4>Consent Status</h4>
      <p>The state or status of <i>consent</i> refers to the stage of information about a particular consent instance within its lifecycle. For example, (given) consent first starts with the identification of need to ask consent, then issuing a request (to the individual), making a decision (by the individual), and then following it up with further actions such as the individual withdrawing it. Keeping track of such information is necessary in order to determine whether the current stage of consent information is suitable for its use in justifying processing of personal data governed by that consent, as well as to fulfil obligations such as to keep records of consent. To assist with such consent information management, DPV provides <i>Consent Status</i> as a way to represent the lifecycle and usefulness of an instance towards processing personal data.</p>
      <p>DPV's Consent Statuses are represented by <code>ConsentStatus</code> and indicated using <code>hasConsentStatus</code> relation. The statuses are segregated into two categories based on their interpretation towards processing: <code>ConsentStatusValidForProcessing</code> and <code>ConsentStatusInvalidForProcessing</code>. There are (currently) only two statuses that are valid for processing: <code>ConsentGiven</code> representing the individual has consented, and <code>RenewedConsentGiven</code> where an earlier given consent is <i>renewed</i>, <i>refreshed</i>, or <i>reaffirmed</i>.</p>
      <p>The rest of (currently) 8 statuses refer to various stages that are considered invalid for processing. These are: <code>ConsentUnknown</code> for when information about the status is unknown or unconfirmed, <code>ConsentRequested</code> for when a request to obtain or give consent has been made, <code>ConsentRequestDeferred</code> for when the request was opted to be dismissed or delayed without a decision, <code>ConsentRefused</code> for when consent was refused, <code>ConsentExpired</code> for when the validity (temporal or otherwise) associated with a given consent instance has lapsed, <code>ConsentInvalidated</code> for when a given consent instance is found invalid e.g. by a court, <code>ConsentRevoked</code> for when a given consent instance is revoked or terminated such as when a service provider stops providing the service, and <code>ConsentWithdrawn</code> for when the individual withdraws a previously given consent.</p>
      {{ list_hierarchy(modules['legal_basis-consent-status']['classes'], head="dpv:ConsentStatus") }}
    </section>

    <section id="vocab-legal-basis-consent-indication">
      <h4>Consent Indication</h4>
      <p>To indicate which entity is responsible for a specific consent stage (e.g. individual for given consent, requester for consent requested), the relation <code>isIndicatedBy</code> is provided. It can be used with any <code>Entity</code> such as <code>DataSubject</code> or its subtypes such as <code>User</code> or specific instances of these to record information regarding who was responsible for the indicated status and consent action. To indicate the method by which an entity has indicated the specific consent, the relation <code>hasIndicationMethod</code> is provided. To indicate the time (or similar temporal information), the relation <code>isIndicatedAtTime</code> is provided.</p>
      <div class="note" title="Common legal concepts/properties">
        <p>The concepts and relations mentioned here regarding consent, such as <i>isIndicatedBy</i>, are also applicable and suitable for use with other legal bases or actions, such as contracts, legal requests, or exercising rights. Therefore, these can also be used in other contexts as deemed suitable. We are working on providing specific concepts and guidance for more detailed representation of information for such other legal bases and actions.</p>
      </div>
      <p>To specify consent provided by delegation, such as in the case of a parent or guardian providing consent for/with a child, the <code>isIndicatedBy</code> relation can be used to associate the parent or guardian responsible for providing consent (or its affirmation). Since by default the consent is presumed to be provided by the individual, when such individuals are associated with their consent, i.e. through <code>hasDataSubject</code>, the additional information provided by <code>isIndicatedBy</code> can be considered redundant and is often omitted.</p>
      <p>To indicate how consent is to be provided or withdrawn e.g. how should an individual express or withdraw their consent, DPV provides <i>Consent Controls</i> as: <code>ProvideConsent</code> for the individual to provide or give their consent, <code>ObtainConsent</code> for the organisation to obtain or collect consent from the individual, <code>WithdrawConsent</code> for the individual to withdraw their given consent, and <code>ReaffirmConsent</code> for entities to re-affirm their previously provided or obtained consent. To indicate how to implement the action e.g. provide consent, the relation <code>isExercisedAt</code> should be used.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>Duration of Consent</h4>
      <p>To indicate the duration or validity of a given consent instance, the existing contextual relation <code>hasDuration</code> along with specific forms of <code>Duration</code> can be used. For example, to indicate consent is valid until a specific event such as account closure, the duration subtype <code>UntilEventDuration</code> can be used with additional instantiation or annotation to indicate more details about the event (in this case the closure of account). Similarly, <code>UntilTimeDuration</code> indicates validity until a specific time instance or timestamp (e.g. 31 December 2022), and <code>TemporalDuration</code> indicates a relative time duration (e.g. 6 months). To indicate validity without an end condition, <code>EndlessDuration</code> can be used.</p>
      <p>While the above information considered <i>duration</i> as determining the validity of given consent, there are also other uses of duration associated with consent. For example, the duration information is intended to be a trigger to confirm or renew consent instead of rendering it invalid immediately. Or, the duration associated with <i>ConsentRequested</i> could be used to indicate when consent should be requested again.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="vocab-legal-basis-consent-controls">
      <h4>Consent Controls</h4>
      <p> represents information about how to exercise a control regarding consent. To indicate how an organisation obtains consent, the concept [=ObtainConsent=] is provided. Its corresponding concept [=ProvideConsent=] specifies how a data subject can indicate their consent (decision). The concept [=ReaffirmConsent=] is used to indicate how to perform reaffirmation or confirmation of a previous control (e.g. provide or obtain consent).</p>
      <p>[=ConsentControl=] allows representing activities associated with control over consent, such as to give/obtain consent, to refuse it, or to withdraw it. These concepts are useful to represent which actions are involved or applicable in the specified context (e.g. to state a notice layer provides controls to accept and refuse consent), and to represent information on how to exercise them (e.g. consent can be withdrawn through the indicated process or at the given url). To associate consent controls, the relation [=hasConsentControl=] is provided.</p>
      <p>The concept [=ManageConsent=] is a broad concept that encompasses other consent controls to reflect its common use in use-cases, such as to provide a common interface to perform all actions associated with consent. The interpretation used here is that managing consent refers to providing, withdrawing, and reaffirming given consent. Refusing consent is not included as part of managing consent currently, but may be added in the future to represent cases where a consent request is received and stored awaiting the individual's decision - where 'managing consent' for the individual would involve both providing and refusing consent.</p>
      <p>Consent controls are defined by extending relevant `dpv:EntityInvolvement` concepts `dpv:OptingIntoProcess` and `dpv:WithdrawingFromProcess` so that commonly used terms such as 'opt-in' and 'opt-out' (more specifically, withdrawing from an opted-in process) are aligned with managing consent by defining them as a broader concept than 'provide consent' and 'withdraw consent' respectively.</p>

    <h3>Legitimate Interest</h3>
    <p>[=LegitimateInterest=] represents a 'legitimate' reason for the entity to carry out an activity. This reason can be about benefits to the entity, or risks/harms to another entity. Where such benefits or risks/harms can be considered to be of 'vital interest', the legal basis [=VitalInterest=] should be used. Where this benefit or risks/harms pertains to the wider society or general public, the legal basis [=PublicInterest=] should be used. Legitimate interests can be associated with the controller, or data subject, or third party, or other entities. As good practice (and for their legality), the relevant entity must always be specified. We recommend using a relevant property such as `dpv:hasDataController` for data controller's legitimate interest to specify this. If a relevant property is not present in DPV, `dpv:hasEntity` can be used.</p>
    <p>[=LegitimateInterestOfController=] represents a legitimate interest of the controller - such as carrying out `dpv:FraudPreventionDetection`. [=LegitimateInterestOfDataSubject=] represents a legitimate interest of the data subject - such as having a copy of the transaction (data or agreement) that it is providing or keeping their own records. [=LegitimateInterestOfThirdParty=] represents a legitimate interest of a third party - for example to investigate  `dpv:CounterTerrorism` activities.</p>
    <p>[=LegitimateInterestStatus=] represents concepts that model the state of legitimate interest in terms of the data subject being informed about it ([=LegitimateInterestInformed=] and [=LegitimateInterestUninformed=]) and whether they have objected to it ([=LegitimateInterestObjected=] and [=LegitimateInterestNotObjected=]). These can be associated or expressed using the relation `dpv:hasStatus`.</p>

  <section id="desc-legal-obligation">
    <h2>Legal Obligation</h2>
    <p>[=LegalObligation=] represents using the justification of an obligation to perform the activity as defined in law or required by a legal procedure such as a court or authority order. When using legal obligations as the legal basis, it is good practice (and necessary for its legality) to also define the specific law or legal mechanism under which the obligation is defined. This can be done using `dpv:hasApplicableLaw`.</p>
    <p>[=LegalObligationStatus=] represents concepts that model the state of legal obligation in terms of it not being initiated or started yet ([=LegalObligationPending=]), where it is ongoing ([=LegalObligationOngoing=], and where it has been completed ([=LegalObligationCompleted=]). These can be expressed or associated using the relation `dpv:hasStatus`.</p>

  <section id="desc-official-authority">
    <h3>Official Authority of Controller</h3>
    <p>[=OfficialAuthorityOfController=] represents the legal basis where the official authority vested in the controller (by law) is used as the justification for carrying out activities. Such official authority is provided to specific departments to enable them to carry out their duties - such as maintenance of tax records, or provision of postal services. The relevant law should be indicated as part of the legal basis if needed by using `dpv:hasApplicableLaw`.</p>
    <p>[=OfficialAuthorityExerciseStatus=] represents the state of the official authority being exercised in terms of it yet to be exercised ([=OfficialAuthorityExercisePending=]), it being exercised ([=OfficialAuthorityExerciseOngoing=]), and the completion of the exercise ([=OfficialAuthorityExerciseCompleted=]). These can be associated or expressed using the relation `dpv:hasStatus`.</p>

  <section id="desc-public-interest">
    <h3>Public Interest</h3>
    <p>[=PublicInterest=] represents activities carried out because they are 'in the interest of the general public' or are necessary to 'provide benefit to the public', where such benefit might be actual benefits (e.g. archiving data of cultural importance) or prevention of harms (e.g. identify relevant medical conditions quickly to prevent an outbreak). We strongly recommend providing a description of the relevant 'benefits' when using this legal basis e.g. by using  `dpv:hasJustification` for contextual justifications associated with the benefit.</p>
    <p>[=PublicInterestStatus=] represents the state of the public interest being exercised or utilised or applied, specifically in terms of when it has been declared but hasn't been utilised yet ([=PublicInterestPending=]), it is being exercised ([=PublicInterestOngoing=]), and the completion of the exercise ([=PublicInterestCompleted=]). These can be associated or expressed using the relation `dpv:hasStatus`.</p>

    <h3>Protecting Vital Interests</h3>
    <p>[=VitalInterest=] represents activities that are necessary or required to protect vital interests of a data subject or other natural person. For more specific indication, [=VitalInterestOfNaturalPerson=] refers to vital interests of (any or a specific) natural person, and [=VitalInterestOfDataSubject=] represents vital interests of (any or a specific) data subject. As with [=PublicInterest=] and [=LegitimateInterest=], we strongly recommend specifying relevant information - the vital interest in this case - by using `dpv:hasJustification`. </p>
    <p>[=VitalInterestStatus=] represents the state of the vital interest being exercised or utilised or applied, specifically in terms of when it is yet to be utilised ([=VitalInterestPending=]), it is being utilised ([=VitalInterestOngoing=]), and it has been applied to completion ([=VitalInterestCompleted=]).</p>
