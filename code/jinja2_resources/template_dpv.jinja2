  <section id="introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
     <p>The motivation of DPV is to provide a '<i>data model</i>' or an '<i>ontology</i>' of concepts for interoperable representation and exchange of information about processing of (personal) data and the use of technologies. For this, the DPV specification defines concepts and relationships using the [[RDF]] standard, and which can additionally be implemented and applied using technologies appropriate to a use-case's specific requirements.</p>
     <p>The DPV specification contains several distinct groups of concepts, some of which are provided with a taxonomy of concepts to support practical use-cases. In addition to these, 'extensions' to the DPV are also provided which further extend one or more DPV concepts or enable separation of concepts - such as for distinguishing between different jurisdictions and laws. The figure below shows an overview of the DPV concepts along with its extensions.</p>
     <figure id="overview-2">

    <section>
      <h3>Semantics</h3>
      <p><em>This document assumes the reader is familiar with DPV through the [[[PRIMER]]], and thus focuses on providing a topically structured documentation of concepts defined by DPV.</em></p>
      
      <p>DPV's terms are defined using [[RDFS]] &amp; [[SKOS]] semantics where all 'classes' and 'properties' are defined as <code>skos:Concept</code> in addition to <code>rdfs:Class</code> and <code>rdf:Property</code> respectively. For taxonomies or hierarchies, concepts are defined as 'instances' of a top-concept, and relationships within the hierarchy are defined using <code>skos:broader/skos:narrower</code>. For example, [=Purpose=] is the top concept within the purposes taxonomy, and all concepts in the purpose taxonomy are instances of it, and are related to each other using <code>skos:broader/narrower</code> relations, such as  [=ServiceProvision=] and its more specific form [=RequestedServiceProvision=] are both instances of [=Purpose=] while being related to each other using <code>skos:broader/narrower</code>.</p>
      
      <p>[[[DPV-OWL]]] is an alternate serialisation of DPV that contains the same concepts but is provided under a different namespace with the semantics defined using [[OWL]]. The conversion from SKOS to OWL follows the best practices and concerns outlined in [[[SKOS-OWL]]], e.g. by replacing <code>skos:Concept</code> with <code>owl:Class</code>, and using <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code> instead of <code>skos:broader/skos:narrower</code>. See the <a href="../primer/#example-implications-of-using-skos-vs-owl">example showing implications of using SKOS vs OWL</a> in the [[PRIMER]].</p>

      <p>DPV consists of certain 'core concepts' that are intended to be independent representations of specific information, and are distinct from other core concepts. For example, the [=Purpose=] refers only to the <i>purpose of why personal data is processed</i> and is independent as a concept from the other concepts (e.g. [=PersonalData=] or [=LegalBasis=]). The structuring of DPV is based on providing rich and comprehensive taxonomies that group concepts together based on each core concept, e.g. taxonomy of purposes, taxonomy of legal basis. 'Extensions' are a separate group of concepts that expand the 'core' vocabulary to represent specific information e.g. [[PD]] for personal data categories and [[RISK]] for risk management.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="scope-change">
      <h3>Scope Change in v2.0</h3>
      <p>In DPV v1.0, the scope of the DPV and the DPVCG was limited to 'privacy', 'data protection', and the 'processing of personal data', including technologies used to perform it. Under this scope, the DPVCG discussed and modelled regulations such as the [[EU-GDPR]] which also share the same scope. Newer laws such as the [[EU-DGA]] and [[EU-AIAct]] share a significant overlap with this scope and necessitate their inclusion in DPVCG activities. However, such laws utilise the same legal framework to model both personal and non-personal data (for DGA) or regulate a technology that goes beyond 'personal data' (DGA and AI Act). To enable their inclusion and representation as extensions to the DPV, and to enable adopters to utilise a single consistent framework to represent information, the scope of DPVCG and the DPV was expanded in v2.0 as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Expansion of scope to include 'data' and 'technologies' instead of only 'personal data' - this means concepts such as [=Purpose=] which were defined as purpose associated with 'personal data' are now defined as purpose associated with 'data or technologies'.</li>
        <li>Creation of concepts to represent expanded scope - such as [=Data=] as the broader concept for both [=PersonalData=] and [=NonPersonalData=].</li>
        <li>Changing the scope of associated extensions such as [[TECH]] and [[RISK]] to be useful for any technology and activities and not just personal data related technologies and activities.</li>
        <li>Creating [[AI]] as a new extension to specifically provide concepts associated with AI technologies.</li>
        <li>Creating extensions to represent concepts from laws regarding 'data and technologies' based on the new concepts and extensions created e.g. [[EU-DGA]] and [[EU-AIAct]] extensions.</li>
        <li>Creating new namespaces such as <code>/legal/eu/gdpr</code> instead of <code>/dpv-gdpr</code> to enable consisting and unambiguous representation of legal extensions</li>
        <li>Restructuring the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv">GitHub repository</a> to accommodate the changed structure of DPV extensions</li>
      </ol>
      <p>In addition to the above, the v2.0 scope change also includes removal of the bespoke 'DPV serialisation' which was based on a custom extension of [[SKOS]]. Instead, the RDFS+SKOS serialisation has been made the default serialisation, and the alternate OWL2 serialisation is continued as before.</p>
      <aside class="note" title="Focus of DPVCG on privacy and data protection">
        <p>Though the scope of DPVCG has expanded significantly from 'personal data' to also include 'any data and technologies', the primary focus of the group remains on privacy and data protection. Therefore, while the group is developing work such as the [[AI]] and [[EU-AIAct]] extensions, it is also interested in understanding how these involve personal data and affect privacy and data protection, and how the DPV and its extensions can help address concerns - such as through taxonomies to support risk and impact assessments in [[RISK]] extension.</p>
        <p>The DPVCG welcomes work associated with [[AI]] or [[EU-AIAct]] and other similar activities which go beyond privacy and data protection, such as AI specific risks and impacts. Such additions are useful to support the group's primary objectives as they help discuss and determine when risks and impacts involve personal data and have an effect on privacy and data protection.</p>
      </aside>
      <aside class="note" title="DPV v2.0 is backwards-compatible with DPV v1.0">
        <p>The redefinition of concepts in DPV v2.0 is backwards compatible as there has only been a scope 'increase' i.e. use of [=Purpose=] in DPV v1.0 regarding 'personal data' is compatible with [=Purpose=] in DPV v2.0 regarding 'data and technologies'.</p>
        <p>Specific changes in concepts result in limited breaking of compatibility as these concepts have been removed or remodelled. See the <a href="#changelog">Changelog</a> for more specific information.</p>

  <h2>Process</h2>
  <figure>
    <img src="../diagrams/process.svg">
    <figcaption>Example of Process being associated with other DPV concepts</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>To 'group' the core concepts together within a specific use-case, the concept [=Process=] and relation [=hasProcess=] are useful (the concept [=PersonalDataHandling=] was used in earlier versions for the same). For example, a 'process' about a specific application can represent the associated purposes, personal data, legal basis, etc. using the relations and provided taxonomies. Involvement or association of a process is indicated with the relation [=hasProcess=].</p>
  <aside class="note" title="PersonalDataHandling in v1.0 is replaced with Process in v2.0">
    <p>The concept [=PersonalDataHandling=] in DPV v1.0 was defined to perform the role of combining other concepts in to 'unit', similar to what [=Process=] is described above. From DPV v2.0 onwards, <i>Process</i> is recommended to be used instead of <i>PersonalDataHandling</i> as it better suits the terminology used in use-cases and is an existing well-defined concept. The concept <i>PersonalDataHandling</i> and relation [=hasPersonalDataHandling=] will be deprecated in future iterations of DPV.</p>
    <p>Existing uses of [=PersonalDataHandling=] and [=hasPersonalDataHandling=] can be safely replaced with [=Process=] and [=hasProcess=] respectively. Semantically, [=Process=] is the super-class of [=PersonalDataHandling=] which makes instances of [=PersonalDataHandling=] also an instance of [=Process=].</p>
  </aside>
  <p>The following processes categories are provided to indicate e.g. the process is or is not expected to involve personal data:</p>
  {{ list_hierarchy(modules['process']['classes'], lang=lang) }}
  {{ example_aside('dex:E0005') }}
  <section id="vocab-process-nested">
    <h3>Nested Processes</h3>
    <p>Instances of <code>Process</code> can be nested, which means one instance can contain other instances, much like a box with several smaller boxes inside. This permits breaking down complex or dense use-cases into more granular ones and representing them in a more precise and modular fashion. Such a representation also facilitates reuse of the granular or modular processes, or in defining 'templates' and 'patterns', for example to craft a single process representing collecting and storing email addresses and using it in different processes for different purposes.</p>
    <p>From the earlier example, consider the situation where a single <code>Process</code> instance consists of two additional instances representing: (i) data is stored using a data processor, (ii) data is used for Marketing. While it is certainly possible to represent all of this information within one single instance of <code>Process</code>, the adopter may decide to create separate instances of <code>Process</code> based on requirements such as reflecting similar separations for legal documentation or accountability purposes.</p>
    {{ example_aside('dex:E0006') }}
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Interpretation of Process</h3>
    <p>Where multiple concepts such as purposes and data are present in the same process, the interpretation is that they all apply e.g. each purpose applies to each personal data, and so on. If this is not the case, then nested processes should be used to separate the groups so that only those  concepts are present within the same process which occur or are associated with each other.</p>
    <p>Such arrangements can also be used to separate necessary and optional parts of a process, and can aid in avoiding duplication of processes where only a few elements need to be distinguished. For example, if a purpose has necessary and optional data associated with it, it is possible to create two nested processes containing the purpose and the necessary data in one process, and the process and optional data in another. However, such duplication is not necessary, the 'parent' or 'outer' process can contain the purpose and the nested processes can contain only the differentiating elements i.e. one nested process contains the necessary data and the other contains the optional data.</p>
    <p>Processes are also be useful to indicate separation of responsibilities - for example where some processing is conducted by one processor and another by a different processor, with each nested process corresponding to the processing activities of one processor.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section id="vocab-process-service">
    <h3>Services</h3>
    <p>The concept [=Service=] is a general concept that represents the legal and social notion of 'service', similar to provided 'product' or 'application' or 'process', and does not represent the technical notion of services such as those associated with operating systems or 'cloud services'. Service is useful to indicate a logical grouping of processes into a single 'unit' which has legal relevance - such as a contract covering the service or the provision of a service. To indicate a service is associated or involved, the relation [=hasService=] is provided.</p>
    <aside class="note" title="Service does not refer to technical service concepts">
      <p>Adopters are cautioned against using [=Service=] to represent technical concepts such as those used for operating systems or the technical concept of a 'cloud service' architecture or infrastructure. Adopters should use the [[TECH]] extension which provides such technical concepts.</p>
    </aside>
    <p>To indicate the entities involved in services, the concepts [=ServiceProvider=] and [=ServiceConsumer=] are defined along with the relations [=hasServiceProvider=] and [=hasServiceConsumer=]. Entities acting as providers and consumers can also be controllers or processors or data subjects. For example, a controller or processor may be the service provider for another controller who is the service consumer. Similarly, a processor may be the service provider for data subjects under the instructions of a data controller.</p>

  <p>DPV relies on existing well-founded interpretations for its concepts, which in this case relate to [=Entity=] as a generic universal concept and [=hasEntity=] as the relation used to associate it. The concept [=LegalEntity=] refers to entities defined legally or within legal norms. Expanding on these, DPV provides a taxonomy of entities based on their application within laws and use-cases in the form of <a href="#vocab-entities-legalrole"><i>Legal roles</i></a>, such as [=DataController=], [=DataSubject=], and [=Authority=] along with corresponding relations [=hasDataController=], [=hasDataProcessor=], and [=hasAuthority=]. Later, these concepts are expanded into taxonomies for different kinds of entities categorised under a common concept. For example, as <a href="#vocab-entities-organisation">categories of <i>Organisations</i></a>.</p>

    <h3>Legal Roles</h3>
    <p><i>Legal Role</i> is the role taken on by a legal entity based on definitions or criteria from laws, regulations, or other such normative sources. Legal roles assist in representing the role and responsibility of an entity within the context of processing, and from this to determine the requirements and obligations that should apply, and their compliance or conformance. Concepts are also accompanied with relations to enable using or associating them within the context.</p>

    <p>The concept [=Authority=] is a specific Governmental Organisation authorised to enforce a law or regulation. Authorities can be associated with a specific domain, topic, or jurisdiction. DPV currently defines regional authorities for [=NationalAuthority=], [=RegionalAuthority=], and [=SupraNationalAuthority=], and [=DataProtectionAuthority=] represents authorities associated with data protection and privacy. To associate authorities with concepts, the relations [=hasAuthority=] to indicate an authority is applicable within a context and [=isAuthorityFor=] to indicate the authority's scope or applicability are provided.</p>

Some examples of such types are agency-based roles: [=Adult=] and [=Child=], [=ParentOfHuman=], [=GuardianOfHuman=]; those associated with vulnerability: [=VulnerableHuman=], [=ElderlyHuman=], [=AsylumSeeker=]; domain-specific roles such as [=Patient=], [=Employee=], [=Student=], jurisdictional roles such as [=Citizen=], [=NonCitizen=], [=Immigrant=]; and general roles such as [=User=], [=Member=], [=Participant=], and [=Client=].</p>
    <p>[=DataSubject=] is a specific category of [=HumanSubject=] that indicates the person is the subject of (their personal) data. It can be associated through the relation [=hasDataSubject=].</p>
    <aside class="note" title="Potential breaking change in v2.1 for existing uses of dpv:DataSubject">
      <p>Since DPV v2.1, the concept [=HumanSubject=] represents humans who are a subject of something (in DPV, it could be data or technologies such as AI). The concept [=DataSubject=] is a specific subcategory where humans are the subject of processing of (their) personal data. This allows the taxonomy of subjects, which were initially defined only for data subjects, to be used for subjects involved in other contexts such as `tech:Subject`.</p>
      <p>The introduction of [=HumanSubject=] can cause a (minor) breaking change for use-cases where the [=DataSubject=] categories were being used as these are now defined as instances of [=HumanSubject=] instead of [=DataSubject=] e.g. populating a dropdown by querying categories of data subjects. Semantically, this is not an issue as [=DataSubject=] is a subclass of [=HumanSubject=]. Therefore, the fix is to change the implementation to use categories of [=HumanSubject=] instead e.g. the dropdown mentioned earlier is populated using categories of human subjects instead of data subjects.

  <p>DPV’s taxonomy of purposes is used to represent the goal or reason associated with processing of personal data and use of technologies. For this, purposes are organised within DPV based on several factors such as: management functions related to information (e.g. records, account, finance), fulfilment of objectives (e.g. delivery of goods), providing goods and services (e.g. service provision), intended benefits (e.g. optimisations for service provider or consumer), and legal compliance.</p>
  <p>DPV provides a taxonomy of Purpose <i>instances</i> for use with [=hasPurpose=] relation. In addition, DPV also defines the concept [=Sector=] (associated using [=hasSector=]) to indicate a contextual interpretation of the purpose within a specified sector. The [[[SECTOR]]] provide further concepts for purposes specific to a sector, for example [[SECTOR-EDUCATION]], [[SECTOR-HEALTH]], and [[SECTOR-LAW]].</p>

  <p>DPV provides the concept [=Data=] and relation [=hasData=] to indicate involvement or association of any data. The concept [=PersonalData=] and the relation [=hasPersonalData=] are provided to indicate what categories or instances of personal data are being processed. The DPV specification only provides a structure for describing personal data, e.g. as being sensitive. For specific categories of personal data for use-cases, [[[PD]]] provides additional concepts that extend the DPV's personal data taxonomy. This separation is to enable adopters to decide whether the extension's concepts are useful to them, or to use other external vocabularies, or define their own.</p>
  <p>In addition to <i>Personal Data</i>, there may be a need to represent <i>Non-Personal Data</i> within the same contextual use-cases. For this, DPV provides the concepts [=NonPersonalData=] and [=SyntheticData=].</p>
  <p>To indicate data categorised based on [=DataSource=], e.g. as "collected personal data", DPV provides: [=CollectedPersonalData=], [=DerivedPersonalData=], [=InferredPersonalData=], [=GeneratedPersonalData=], and [=ObservedPersonalData=].</p>
  <p>For indicating personal data which is sensitive, the concept [=SensitivePersonalData=] is provided. For indicating special categories of data, the concept [=SpecialCategoryPersonalData=] is provided. In this, the concept <i>sensitive</i> indicates that the data needs additional considerations (and perhaps caution) when processing, such as by increasing its security, reducing usage, or performing impact assessments. <i>Special categories</i>, by contrast, are a 'special' type of sensitive personal data requiring additional considerations or obligations defined in laws (or through other forms) that regulate how they should be used or prohibit their use until specific obligations are met.</p>
  <p>To specify data is anonymised, DPV provides two concepts. [=AnonymisedData=] for when data is completely anonymised and cannot be de-anonymised, which is a subtype of [=NonPersonalData=]. And, [=PseudonymisedData=] for when data has only been partially anonymised or de-anonymisation is possible, which is a subtype of [=PersonalData=].</p>

  </figure>
  {{ ref_dedicated_documentation("modules/processing", "processing") }}
  <p>DPV’s taxonomy of processing concepts reflects the variety of terms used to denote processing activities or operations involving personal data, such as those from [GDPR] Article.4-2 definition of processing. Real-world use of terms associated with processing rarely uses this same wording or terms, except in cases of specific domains and in legal documentation. On the other hand, common terms associated with processing are generally restricted to: collect, use, store, share, and delete.</p>
  <p>DPV provides a taxonomy that aligns both the legal terminologies such as those defined by GDPR with those commonly used. For this, concepts are organised based on whether they subsume other concepts, e.g. Use is a broad concept indicating data is used, which DPV extends to define specific processing concepts for Analyse, Consult, Profiling, and Retrieving. Through this mechanism, whenever an use-case indicates it consults some data, it can be inferred that it also uses that data.</p>

  <section id="vocab-processing-profiling-tracking">
    <h3>Profiling &amp; Tracking</h3>
    <p>To indicate that the process involves profiling and tracking processing operations, the concepts [=Profiling=] and [=Tracking=] are provided. While profiling and tracking are more complex concepts as compared to collect or use or store as 'simple' operations, they are included in the processing operations taxonomy as they represent specific ways of using (personal) data, and by themselves do not provide sufficient indication of the <i>purpose</i> or intended objective for why they are being performed.</p>
    <p>[=Tracking=] is further distinguished as [=TrackingByFirstParty=] and [=TrackingByThirdParty=] to reflect the commonly used terms for tracking performed by entities considered as 'first' and 'third' parties within a context. While the DPV itself does not (yet) model these first/third relations, these concepts reflect existing uses of the term and therefore the DPV relies on these existing definitions and uses to guide the usage of these concepts. For reference, see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt/#terminology">Do Not Track terminology</a> page. Similarly, DPV's definition of [=Profiling=] is a minimal representation of creating a profile of a person based on the use of (some) data. To indicate specific definitions of profiling, e.g. in a law like the EU's GDPR, this concept should be extended to reflect the specific definition, such as the `eu-gdpr:Profiling` concept defined in the [[EU-GDPR]] extension based on the definition in GDPR's Article 4-4.</p>

  <p>DPV provides the following categories of legal bases based on [[GDPR]] Article 6: consent of the data subject, contract, compliance with legal obligation, protecting vital interests of individuals, legitimate interests, public interest, and official authorities. Though derived from GDPR, these concepts can be applied for other jurisdictions and general use-cases. The legal bases are represented by the concept [=LegalBasis=] and associated using the relation [=hasLegalBasis=].</p>

  <p>When declaring a legal basis, it is important to denote under what law or jurisdiction that legal basis applies. For instance, using [=Consent=] as a legal basis has different obligations and requirements in EU (i.e. [[GDPR]]) as compared to other jurisdictions. Therefore, unless the information is to be implicitly interpreted through some specific legal lens or jurisdictional law, DPV recommends indicating the specific law or legal clause associated with the legal basis so as to scope its interpretation. This can be done using the relation [=hasJurisdiction=] or [=hasApplicableLaw=].</p>

  <p>Extensions enable further extending the legal bases with jurisdiction-specific concepts. For example, the [[EU-GDPR]] and [[EU-DGA]] extensions provide legal bases from [[GDPR]] and [[DGA]] respectively.

    <p>To indicate the duration or validity of a given consent instance, the existing contextual relation [=hasDuration=] along with specific forms of [=Duration=] can be used. For example, to indicate consent is valid until a specific event such as account closure, the duration subtype [=UntilEventDuration=] can be used with additional instantiation or annotation to indicate more details about the event (in this case the closure of account). Similarly, [=UntilTimeDuration=] indicates validity until a specific time instance or timestamp (e.g. 31 December 2022), and [=TemporalDuration=] indicates a relative time duration (e.g. 6 months). To indicate validity without an end condition, [=EndlessDuration=] can be used. To indicate the notice used for informed consent, the concept [=ConsentNotice=] is provided, which can be used with the relation [=hasNotice=].</p>
    <p>To specify consent provided by delegation, such as in the case of a parent or guardian providing consent for/with a child, the [=isIndicatedBy=] relation can be used to associate the parent or guardian responsible for providing consent (or its affirmation). Since by default the consent is presumed to be provided by the individual, when such individuals are associated with their consent, i.e. through [=hasDataSubject=], the additional information provided by [=isIndicatedBy=] can be considered redundant and is often omitted.</p>
    <p>[=ConsentControl=] represents information about how to exercise a control regarding consent. To indicate how an organisation obtains consent, the concept [=ObtainConsent=] is provided. Its corresponding concept [=ProvideConsent=] specifies how a data subject can indicate their consent (decision). The concept [=ReaffirmConsent=] is used to indicate how to perform reaffirmation or confirmation of a previous control (e.g. provide or obtain consent). To associate consent controls, the relation [=hasConsentControl=] is provided. Consent controls are defined by extending relevant [=EntityInvolvement=] concepts [=OptingIntoProcess=] and [=WithdrawingFromProcess=].</p>

  <p>To represent location, the concept [=Location=] along with relations [=hasLocation=] is provided. For geo-political locations, the concepts such as [=Country=] and [=SupraNationalUnion=] are provided, with [=hasCountry=] and [=ThirdCountry=] with [=hasThirdCountry=] provided for convenience in common uses (e.g. data storage, transfers).</p>
  <p>To define contextual location concepts, such as there being several locations, or that the location is 'local' to an event, DPV provides two concepts. [=LocationFixture=] specifies whether the location is 'fixed' or 'deterministic', with subtypes for <i>fixed single</i>, <i>fixed multiple</i>, and <i>variable</i> locations. [=LocationLocality=] specifies whether the location is 'local' within the context, with subtypes for <i>local</i>, <i>remote</i>, <i>within a device</i>, or <i>in cloud</i>.</p>
  <p>To represent locations as jurisdictions, the relation [=hasJurisdiction=] is provided. The concept [=Law=] represents an official or authoritative law or regulation created by a government or an authority. To indicate applicability of laws within a jurisdiction, the relation [=hasApplicableLaw=] is provided.</p>
  <p>The [[[LEGAL]]] provides taxonomies extending these concepts, such as to represent specific countries, their laws, authorities, memberships, adequacy decisions, and other information.</p>

  {{ ref_dedicated_documentation("modules/risk", "risk") }}
  <p>For risk management, DPV's provides a lightweight risk ontology based on commonly utilised concepts regarding risk mitigation and risk management. While these concepts permit rudimentary association of risks and mitigations within a use-case, it is important to note that DPV (currently)
    does not provide comprehensive concepts for risk management.</p>
    <p>For more developed representations of risk assessment, mitigation, and management vocabularies, we suggest the adoption of relevant standards, such as the ISO/IEC 31000 series, and welcome contribution for their representation within DPV through [[[RISK]]].</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="../diagrams/rights.svg">
    <figcaption></figcaption>
  </figure>
  {{ ref_dedicated_documentation("modules/rights", "rights") }}
  <p>The concept [=Right=] represents a normative concept for what is permissible or necessary in accordance with a system such as laws. To associate rights with concepts that are relevant or within which those rights occur, the relation [=hasRight=] is used. Rights can be <i>passive</i>, which means they are always applicable without requiring anything to be done, or <i>active</i> where they require some action to be taken to initiate or exercise them. To represent these concepts, DPV uses [=PassiveRight=] and [=ActiveRight=] respectively. Rights can be applicable to different contexts or entities. To differentiate rights applicable or afforded to data subjects, the concept [=DataSubjectRight=] is used.</p>
  <p>The information regarding how to exercise a right is provided through [=RightExerciseNotice=] and associated using the [=isExercisedAt=] relation. This information can specify contextual information through use of other concepts such as [=PersonalDataHandling=] to denote a <i>necessary</i> [=Purpose=] of [=IdentityVerification=] as part of the rights exercise.</p>
  <p>A [=RightExerciseActivity=] represents a concrete instance of a right being exercised. It can include contextual information such as timestamps, durations, entities, etc. that can be part of record-keeping. An activity can be a single <i>step</i> related to rights exercise -- such as the initial request to exercise that right, or its acknowledgement, or the final step taken to fulfil the right (e.g. provide some information), or it can also be a single activity describing the entire rights exercise process(es). To collate related activities associated with a rights exercise (e.g. associated with a specific data subject or a specific request), the concept [=RightExerciseRecord=] is useful. The information provided to describe or in fulfilment of a right exercise is represented by [=RightFulfilmentNotice=] and that associated when a right exercise cannot be fulfilled is represented by [=RightNonFulfilmentNotice=].</p>

  {{ ref_dedicated_documentation("modules/rules", "rules") }}
  <p>DPV provides the concept [=Rule=] to specify requirements, constraints, and other forms of 'rules' that are associated with specific contexts (e.g., processing activities) using the relation [=hasRule=]. DPV provides three forms of Rules to represent [=Permission=], [=Prohibition=] and [=Obligation=], and their corresponding relations [=hasPermission=], [=hasProhibition=] and [=hasObligation=], to indicate a Rule that specifies whether something is permitted, prohibited or an obligation, respectively. DPV does not define additional semantics for rules and limits its scope and focus to provide a simple way to specify permissions, prohibitions, and obligations as common rules associated with activities. For a more extensive and richer set of semantics and concepts to represent rules, DPVCG suggests looking towards other languages, such as [[ODRL]], [[SHACL]], and [[RuleML]] that have been developed with the specific goal of representing and applying rules. We welcome contributions for aligning DPV with these, and for providing guidance on how to complement DPV's rule-based concepts with external languages.</p>

SECTOR and STANDARDS extensions also contain extensions within them modelling specific sectors and standards respectively.</figcaption>
      </figure>
  <p>To supplement the concepts and taxonomies in [[DPV]] for specific applications, use-cases, or to provide separation for better management of terms, we provide several extensions to the DPV.</p>
  <section id="extension-pd">
    <h3>Personal Data (PD)</h3>
      <p>[[[PD]]] provides additional concepts that extend the DPV's personal data taxonomy based on an opinionated structure contributed by R. Jason Cronk from <a href="https://enterprivacy.com/">EnterPrivacy</a>. This separation is to enable adopters to decide whether the extension's concepts are useful to them, or to use other external vocabularies, or define their own.</p>
      <p>Concepts within [[PD]] are broadly structured in top-down fashion by utilising their relevance and origin as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Internal (within the person): e.g. Preferences, Knowledge, Beliefs</li>
        <li>External (visible to others): e.g. Behavioural, Demographics, Physical, Sexual, Identifying</li>
        <li>Household: e.g. personal or household activities</li>
        <li>Social: e.g. Family, Friends, Professional, Public Life, Communication</li>
        <li>Financial: e.g. Transactional, Ownership, Financial Account</li>
        <li>Tracking: e.g. Location, Device based, Contact</li>
        <li>Historical: e.g. Life History</li>
      </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="extension-loc">
    <h3>Locations (LOC)</h3>
    <p>[[[LOC]]] provides additional concepts regarding locations such as countries and regions based on the ISO 3166 standards. It enables representing information such as processing takes place within Ireland, represented by <code>loc:IE</code>, or within European Union (EU) by using <code>loc:EU</code>. We are working on expanding this list to also specify regions, cities, and other pertinent location details, and welcome participation and contributions for this.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="extension-risk">
    <h3>Risk Management (RISK)</h3>
    <p>[[[RISK]]] builds on top of the lightweight risk framework within DPV by providing the following extensive concepts related to risk assessment and management. We are in the process of identifying additional concepts and taxonomies for the risk extension, such as for risk management procedures and the creation of a risk ontology based on ISO standards.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Risk Controls</strong> - categories of measures such as those related to risk source, likelihood, consequence, vulnerability, as well as the intended effect in terms of monitoring, controlling, halting, removing, or reducing.</li>
      <li><strong>Consequences and Impacts</strong> - list of consequences such as data breaches, costs, identity theft and several others that are categorised based on DPV's impact framework i.e. damage, harm, or detriment.</li>
      <li><strong>Scale for Risk Levels, Severity, and Likelihood</strong> - a 7 point qualitative scale to express concepts associated with levels, severity, and likelihood of risk and its consequences.</li>
      <li><strong>Risk Matrix</strong> - an encoded form of risk matrices based on combinations of severity and likelihood along with the resulting risk level. Risk matrix nodes and values are provided for dimensions 3x3, 5x5, and 7x7.</li>
      <li><strong>Incidents, Reports, and Notices</strong> - specifying incidents such as security incidents or data breaches, documenting information about them, and notices used to communicate with other relevant entities such as authorities and data subjects.</li>
      <li><strong>Risk Management</strong> - risk management concepts based on ISO 31000 series.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="extension-tech">
    <h3>Technologies (TECH)</h3>
    <p>[[[TECH]]] extends the DPV's terms to represent further specific details regarding technologies, their management, and relevance to actual real-world tools and systems. It provides concepts for the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Provision method</strong>: System, Component, Algorithm, Service, Goods, Product, Subscription, Fixed Use</li>
      <li><strong>Communication method</strong>: WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS, Cellular Network</li>
      <li><strong>Actors</strong>: Developer, Provider, User, Subject, etc.</li>
      <li><strong>Intended Use</strong>: what the technology was/is intended to be used for</li>
      <li><strong>Documentation</strong>: technical and user manuals and other documentation</li>
      <li><strong>Status</strong>: whether the technology has been released, has been provided, and other statuses</li>
      <li><strong>Tools</strong>: databases, cookies, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The intention and aim of developing the TECH extension is to describe real-world tools and services, such as a specific cloud storage provider, and provide categorisation and metadata to connect it to DPV's concepts, such as to indicate the cloud storage instance features encryption at rest as a technical measure. Through these, the management and documentation of use-cases can be made easier by providing the relationships between tools/services and technical measures as a 'knowledge graph'.</p>

  <section id="extension-ai">
    <h3>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3>
    <p>The [[[AI]]] extension provides concepts specifically regarding AI by extending the [[TECH]] extension. It consists of:</p>

      <li><strong>Capabilities</strong> such as image recognition and text generation</li>
      <li><strong>Lifecycle</strong> such as data collection, training, fine-tuning, etc.</li>
      <li><strong>Risks</strong> such as data poisoning, statistical noise and bias, etc.</li>
      <li><strong>Risk Measures</strong> to address the AI specific risks</li>
      <li><strong>Documentation</strong> such as Data Sheets and Model Cards</li>
      <li><strong>Data</strong> associated with AI development, training, validation, and use.</li>

  <section id="extension-legal">
    <h3>Legal Concepts (LEGAL)</h3>
    <p>[[[LEGAL]]] provides concepts to represent laws, authorities, and other legal concepts in various jurisdictions.

Within this namespace, the specific laws and authorities for that jurisdiction are defined.</p>
    <p>At the moment, the following jurisdictions are defined:</p>
    <ul>
