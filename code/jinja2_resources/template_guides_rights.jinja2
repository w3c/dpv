  <h2>Associating processes with rights</h2>
  <p>
      This section outlines how to indicate existing applicable data subject rights associated with a process,
      using DPV and the EU GDPR extension to represent rights available under the GDPR.
  </p>
  <p>
      A process can be used to express information regarding the what, how, where, who, and why personal data 
      is being processed, as well as what rights exist. 
      For indicating applicable GDPR rights, DPV's
      <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv/legal/eu/gdpr" target="_blank">EU GDPR extension</a> 
      provides a mapping between legal bases and the applicable data subject rights.
      This pattern can be followed by data controllers
      to express which rights are applicable, including rights beyond the ones in the GDPR, e.g., 
      <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv/legal/eu/rights" target="_blank">EU's fundamental rights</a>
      and the rights depicted in other EU regulations or in other jurisdictions.
  </p>
  <aside class="example" id="eu-rights" title="Associate process with applicable rights">
      <p>
          Example of a process where the data controller uses the data subject's email address
          for the provision of services based on GDPR consent and indicates the applicable
          GDPR data subject rights.

  <h2>Notifying rights-related activities</h2>
  <p>
      This section outlines how to provide notices related with rights exercising management.
      Generic <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#RightNotice" target="_blank">right notices</a>
      can be provided to indicate which rights exist, when and where they are applicable, and other relevant information.
      Notices can be associated with specific processes or activities using the 
      <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#hasNotice" target="_blank">hasNotice</a> property.
      <code>dcterms:issued</code> and <code>dcterms:valid</code> can be used to indicate temporal information
      related to notices, i.e., when it was issued and until when it is valid.
      Descriptions and identifiers of the notices and their creators/publishers can be recorded using 
      <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/" target="_blank">DCMI Metadata Terms</a>.
      The notices should also include information about the data controller as well as the entity implementing the notice,
      which can be the data controller or another entity acting on behalf of the data controller,
      using <code>dpv:hasDataController</code> and <code>dpv:isImplementedByEntity</code>, respectively.
      <code>foaf:page</code> can be used to indicate a document, e.g., Webpage, containing the contents of the
      notice and further functionalities.

  <aside class="example" id="right-notice" title="Notice with applicable rights">

          The notice has information about the data controller as well as the entity implementing it.
          The webpage available at <code>https://example.org/DataController/RightNotice</code>
          can be consulted for a human-readable version of the notice.

      For GDPR-specific notices, the 
      <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv/legal/eu/gdpr" target="_blank">EU GDPR extension</a> 
      provides concepts for 
      <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv/legal/eu/gdpr#DirectDataCollectionNotice" target="_blank">direct</a> and 
      <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv/legal/eu/gdpr#IndirectDataCollectionNotice" target="_blank">indirect</a>
      data collection notices, required by GDPR's Articles 13 and 14, respectively, 
      <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv/legal/eu/gdpr#SARNotice" target="_blank">Subject Access Request (SAR) notices</a>
      to fulfil GDPR Right of Access, and
      <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv/legal/eu/gdpr#RightsRecipientsNotice" target="_blank">recipient notices</a>
      to fulfil GDPR's Art.19 notification requirements, regarding the recipients to whom a rights exercise 
      has been communicated, such as the right to rectification (Art.16), right to erasure (Art.17) or right to restriction 
      of processing (Art.18).
  </p>
  <p>
      In the case of GDPR's Articles 13 and 14, the data subject should be notified of the identity and contacts of the 
      data controller and of the controller's representative if applicable, as well as receive notice of the contact details 
      of the controller's data protection officer. The notice should also include the purposes and legal basis for data 
      processing, and, in case such basis is the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, said
      interests should be specified. Data subjects should also be made aware of any recipients or categories of recipients
      of the personal data, and, if applicable, about transfers of personal data to a third country or international 
      organisation, including the existence or absence of an adequacy decision for said country and applicable safeguards.
      Furthermore, data subjects should be notified with regards to the data storage period, as well as their existing rights,
      namely the rights to withdraw consent and to lodge a complaint and the rights of access, rectification, erasure, 
      restriction of processing, object and data portability.
      In case the provision of personal data is necessary for statutory or contractual obligations or there is automated 
      decision-making, it should also be disclosed to the data subject.
      Beyond the previously mentioned information, GDPR's Article 14 also requires the data subject to be notified about
      processed categories of data and their respective sources.

  <p>
      In the case of the SAR notice, a DPV process can be used to notify the data subject about the type of personal data 
      being processed, the purpose for the processing, and to which recipients it was disclosed.
      The storage period of the data is also indicated, as well as the existence of other data subject rights 
      and the source of the data if not collected from the data subject.
      In case there is automated decision-making, it should also be disclosed to the data subject.

  <div class="issue" title="Modelling of categories of recipients">
      According to GDPR's Articles 13, 14, and 15, in the case data is shared with any recipients, these can be notified to the
      data subject by their category type instead of naming each recipient individually. DPV currently does not have 
      such a taxonomy. Can we reuse an existent one or should we define one in DPV itself?

      According to GDPR's Articles 13, 14, and 15, in the case of the existence of automated decision-making, 
      including profiling, the data subject must be informed about it when exercising its right of access.
      While DPV already includes concepts to model automation and decision-making, work still needs to be done to 
      come up with a model to represent information <i>"about the logic involved, as well as the significance and 
      the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject"</i>.

<section id="records">
  <h2>Recording rights being exercised</h2>
  <p>
      This section outlines the information that needs to be recorded and maintained when a concrete 
      instance of a right was or is being exercised. Keeping such records is of interest to data controllers 
      to have machine-readable information about the status and fulfillment of requests, which can be used, 
      e.g., by auditors. To represent concrete records of rights being exercised, the 
      <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#RightExerciseRecord" target="_blank">RightExerciseRecord</a> concept, 
      a subclass of DPV's  <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#Record" target="_blank">Record</a>, 
      can be used to associate a particular request, or even distinct requests from the same data subject, 
      with corresponding activities exercised by entities towards fulfilling such requests, modelled as 
      <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#RightExerciseActivity" target="_blank">RightExerciseActivity</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Rights exercise activities</h3>
  <p>
      A <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#RightExerciseActivity" target="_blank">RightExerciseActivity</a>
      represents an instantiation of an activity being performed towards the exercising of a right.
      Such activity instances should include metadata, e.g., timestamps, duration, or involved
      entities, to track the provenance of a particular right exercising process, from the request itself to
      its acknowledgement by the data controller and to the fulfilment or non-fulfilment of the right.
      For easy record-keeping, each activity should be modelled as a
      <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#RightExerciseActivity" target="_blank">RightExerciseActivity</a> instance,
      which can be connected with other instances using DPV's
      <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#isBefore" target="_blank">isBefore</a> and
      <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#isAfter" target="_blank">isAfter</a> concepts.
  </p>
  <p>
      In order to justify a certain right exercise activity, DPV contains a 
      <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv/justifications" target="_blank">Justification</a> extension to
      <i>"enable representing specific justifications associated with non-fulfilment, non-requirement, 
      delays, and exercising reasons involved in processes"</i>, which can be used to justify the 
      non-fulfilment, non-requirement, delays, and exercising of rights.

  <div class="issue" title="Associate justification with GDPR provision">
      How to connect a justification associated with a right exercising activity with the the GDPR

      <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#RequestRejected" target="_blank">RequestRejected</a> 
      for a request being rejected towards non-fulfilment or
      <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#RequestRequiresAction" target="_blank">RequestRequiresAction</a> 
      for a request requiring an action to be performed from another party.
      <a href="#status">Figure 1</a> illustrates the sequence in which these concepts occur. Once the request 
      is initiated, it should be then acknowledged by the entity implementing it and either accepted towards fulfilment
      or rejected towards non-fulfilment. Additionally, after being rejected, the entity fulfilling the
      request can also require further action from the requester (e.g., request additional data to be able
      to fulfil the request), which can delay the acceptance or rejection of the request, and after the
      required action is performed, the request can either be accepted towards fulfilment or get rejected
      again towards non-fulfilment or towards asking again for further action.

  <p>
      DPV's concepts can be used in conjunction with the 
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/" target="_blank">W3C's PROV-O recommendation</a>
      to track the provenance of a right exercising activity instance. Using this
      standard, provenance information, regarding the entities whom the activity is associated with, i.e.,
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#wasAssociatedWith" target="_blank">prov:wasAssociatedWith</a>, 
      or what data/notice was generated, i.e., 
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#generated" target="_blank">prov:generated</a>,
      by the right exercise activity, can be represented. 
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#actedOnBehalfOf" target="_blank">prov:actedOnBehalfOf</a> can also be
      used to represent delegation or representation, for instance when a parent exercises a right on behalf of its child. 
      Similarly to notices, temporal information, descriptions and identifiers of the activities and their
      creators/publishers can be recorded using <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/" target="_blank">DCMI Metadata Terms</a>.

      In this section, we include examples of rights exercising activities covering the lifecycle of statuses of requests,
      using an exercised GDPR right of access as an example.

      <p>
          Example of a right exercising activity related to a GDPR right of access request. The activity 
          associated with the start of the request has the status <code>dpv:RequestInitiated</code>, 
          the data subject is identified using the <code>dpv:hasDataSubject</code> property and the recipient of the request, 
          a data controller, using <code>dpv:hasRecipientDataController</code>. Furthermore, a process instance
          can be used to express what personal data needs to be processed for the fulfilment of the right -
          in this case, an account identifier of the data subject will be collected and stored by the data controller
          for identity verification purposes. DPV's <code>hasScope</code> can also be used to specify the scope of the 
          request, e.g., the data subject only wants to access data processed for service provision purposes during 2022.

      In this <a href="#activity-Fulfilled">latest example</a>, a SAR notice is not included as

  </p>
  <p>
      Moreover, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/" target="_blank">DCAT</a> can be used to model resources 
      beyond notices, for instance, a copy of the personal data, which is required in both GDPR's access and data
      portability rights. DCAT promotes the usage of the properties such as <code>dcterms:format</code>, 
      <code>dcterms:valid</code>, and <code>dcat:landingPage</code> to include information regarding the format, validity 
      and dataset provision location, respectively, to characterize the dataset in question.
      Additionally, DCAT promotes the usage of ODRL to express license and rights statements, by linking the dataset with 
      an ODRL policy using the <code>odrl:hasPolicy</code> property, or the usage of DCMI Metadata Terms' <code>license</code>,
      <code>accessRights</code> or <code>rights</code> properties to link datasets with licenses, access rights statements
      or other types of rights statements, e.g., copyrights, respectively. The latter can be used to express 'high-level'
      access control statements, e.g., embargoed, restricted or open access, while the former has the advantage of also being
      a W3C Recommendation, for policy expression, which provides a model to represent complex policies and an easy mechanism
      to extend its model to cover other use cases.
  </p>
  <p>
      In this Section, the GDPR's Right of Access is used as an example to showcase how to model right exercising activities 
      using DPV, DCMI Metadata Terms, PROV-O and DCAT. However, a similar pattern can be followed by data controllers to 
      fulfil the other rights as in most cases the only substantial change would be the notice concept that needs to be used 
      for a particular right instance, e.g., <code>eu-gdpr:DirectDataCollectionNotice</code> for the right fulfilment notice
      related to GDPR's Article 13, <code>eu-gdpr:IndirectDataCollectionNotice</code> for the right
      fulfilment notice related to GDPR's Article 14 or <code>eu-gdpr:RightsRecipientsNotice</code>
      for the right fulfilment notice related to GDPR's Article 19.
      Additionally, the proposed model for right exercising activities is generic enough to support the representation of rights
      from other jurisdictions and can be easily extended if the need arises.

  <p>
      For integration with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/" target="_blank">DCAT</a>-based systems, right 
      exercise records can also adapt DCAT's standard to represent data catalogs - a right exercise record can also be 
      modelled as a <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#Catalog" target="_blank">dcat:Catalog</a> and right exercise activities 
      as <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#Resource" target="_blank">dcat:Resource</a>s, which can be bundled and ordered 
      using <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#DatasetSeries" target="_blank">dcat:DatasetSeries</a>.
      This also brings the advantage of using DCAT's ordering properties, i.e., 
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#first" target="_blank">dcat:first</a>, 
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#last" target="_blank">dcat:last</a>, and
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#prev" target="_blank">dcat:prev</a>, 
      to retrieve the latest activity related to a particular rights-related request.
  </p>
  <aside class="example" id="record-dcat" title="Record maintained by the data controller for the data subject's rights-related requests using DCAT">
      <p>
          Example of a right exercise record maintained by the data controller for all the data subject's rights-related 
          requests. A catalog record is maintained to describe metadata about the right exercise record, including
          the involved data controller and data subject. As it stands, the data subject has opened two requests,
          <code>ex:request-001</code> and <code>ex-request-002</code>. The right exercising activities pertaining to these
          requests are collected and ordered in <code>ex:request-001-series</code> and <code>ex:request-002-series</code>, 
          respectively. As such, the <code>dcat:last</code> property can be used to retrieve the latest activity of each
          request.
