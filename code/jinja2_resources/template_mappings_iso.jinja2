    <p>This document provides a mapping from core or foundational ISO standards to DPV concepts to assist implementations using both of them together. Currently, this activity is a work in progress and the DPVCG welcomes contributions and participation for it.</p>

<section id="introduction">
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The DPV and other specifications produced by the DPVCG have utilised terms from various sources -- such as ISO standards, regulations such as GDPR, as well as original concepts developed by the community. To support the use of DPV with ISO standards, this document provides a mapping between the concepts provided in DPV with those defined in core or foundational ISO standards. The goal of this exercise is to provide sufficient information on how DPV concepts align with the core ISO standards, and to enable the further use of DPV in their implementations. This mapping is also provided in <a href="dpv-iso.ttl">RDF</a> and <a href="dpv-iso.csv">CSV</a> form for convenience.</p>
  <aside class="note" title="Future Work ; Contributions Welcome">
    <p>The DPVCG welcomes contributions to this work, in particular to expand upon the mapping of 29100 to DPV, as well as to add other mappings such as for 27000.</p>
    <p>We also welcome improvements to this document to explain how different ISO standards align or relate to specific DPVCG work, such as suggesting cybersecurity standards as being relevant to DPV's technical measures taxonomy, or those associated with risk management to the RISK extension.</p>

  <h2>Mapping</h2>
  <p>The following is a mapping between concepts defined in <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/85938.html">ISO/IEC 29100:2024 Information technology — Security techniques — Privacy framework</a> with those provided in [[[DPV]]].</p>
