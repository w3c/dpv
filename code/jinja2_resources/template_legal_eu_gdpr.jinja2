    <p>The [[EU-GDPR]] extension provides concepts extending the [[DPV]] to represent information requirements from the [[GDPR]]. It enables the use of DPV to represent use-cases that are regulated by the GDPR, such as using specific legal bases defined in the GDPR, or to represent the applicability of rights, or requirements for conducting data protection impact assessments. It also enables representing practicalities such as organisations and their 'establishments' in the EU, data breach reporting and impact assessments, and data transfer tools. In particular, the [[EU-GDPR]] extension provides the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#vocab-legal-basis">Legal Bases</a> for processing personal data as defined in Articles 6 and 9 (special categories of personal data) and 45-49 (data transfer)</li>

  <section id="vocab-legal-basis">
    <h2>Legal Basis</h2>
    <p>GDPR Article 6 specifies that it is mandatory for every processing to have one (or more) legal basis that justifies its compliance. These are represented as <a href="#vocab-legal-basis-core">Core Legal Basis</a> concepts by extending relevant <code>dpv:LegalBasis</code> concepts, such as for consent or contract. Similarly, Article 9 legal basis are represented as <a href="#vocab-legal-basis-special">Special Category Legal Basis</a>, and those from Articles 45, 46, and 49 are represented as instances of <code>dpv:DataTransferLegalBasis</code> to create <a href="#vocab-legal-basis-data-transfer">Data Transfer Legal Basis</a>.</p>
    <aside class="note" title="DPV does not define validity of legal basis">
      <p>[[DPV]] and the [[EU-GDPR]] extension represents legal basis and their use as well as validity as concepts, and evaluating compliance or assessing the validity of specific instances is not in the scope of this work. For example, determining whether an instance of given consent is valid, or the appropriateness of a legal basis for its application in a use-case. The DPVCG is interested in providing "helpful assistance" to support such tasks through its concepts, and welcomes discussions and contributions for the same. Planned work regarding this includes providing 'hints' or 'suggestions' for which [[EU-GDPR]] legal basis can be used for specific [[DPV]] purposes based on authoritative guidance and case law.</p>
    </aside>
    <aside class="example" title="Expressing GDPR consent and contract as the legal basis">
      <p>This example demonstrates using the EU-GDPR to indicate Art.6-1b contract as the legal basis, and using Art.9-2a explicit consent as the legal basis.</p>
      <pre class="nohighlight"><code>ex:PDH1 a dpv:Process ;
  dpv:hasPersonalData pd:EmailAddress ;
  dpv:hasLegalBasis eu-gdpr:A6-1-b . # contract performance

ex:PDH2 a dpv:Process ;
  dpv:hasPersonalData pd:BloodType ; # special category
  dpv:hasLegalBasis eu-gdpr:A9-2-a . # explicit consent
      </code></pre>
    </aside>
    <aside class="example" title="Expressing legal basis using both DPV and EU-GDPR">
      <p>This example shows how DPV concepts are general/abstract notions of legal basis, and the use of extensions such as EU-GDPR enables expressing legally defined legal basis for accurate representation of requirements. It first represents a process which uses DPV consent to indicate, in general, that consent is the legal basis for the process, and EU-GDPR to specificly indicate that the consent is as defined in Art.6-1a. The second process demonstrates declaring explicitly expressed consent as the legal basis with GDPR as the applicable law, but no explicit reference to a particular clause within GDPR. The implication of this is that an assessment is necessary to determine how the consent must be interpreted within GDPR's framework as the personal data involved is of special category. Therefore, where GDPR is known to be applied, we recommend specifying the EU-GDPR defined legal basis by itself or in addition to the general legal basis from DPV.</p>
      <pre class="nohighlight"><code>ex:PDH1 a dpv:Process ;
  dpv:hasLegalBasis dpv:ExpressedConsent ; # general legal basis
  dpv:hasLegalBasis eu-gdpr:A6-1-a . # GDPR specific consent

# This is okay to do, but is not legally complete.
# Suggested to (also) use eu-gdpr:A9-2-a as the legal basis to indicate
# that the explicitly expressed consent is asserted to be as per GDPR.
ex:PDH2 a dpv:Process ;
  dpv:hasPersonalData pd:BloodType ; # special category
  dpv:hasLegalBasis dpv:ExplicitlyExpressedConsent ;
  dpv:hasApplicableLaw eu:GDPR . # which consent as per to GDPR?

    <div class="note" title="Providing implementations of Data Transfer Tools">
      <p>The EU-GDPR's concepts for transfer tools are currently symbolic, and do not provide a way to actually implement those tools.

    <h2>DPIA</h2>
    <p>[[GDPR]] Article 35 specifies the conditions and requirements associated with Data Protection Impact Assessments. EU-GDPR expands on the <code>DPIA</code> concept defined as an Organisational Measure within DPV by considering a DPIA as consisting of the following iterative process, and providing statuses for documenting their progression and outputs:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Identifying activities for which a DPIA is to be undertaken (represented using DPV and EU-GDPR)</li>
      <li>Checking whether a DPIA is needed as per GDPR Art.35 and other jurisdictional requirements: the activitiy is [=DPIANecessityAssessment=] and its output is denoted using [=DPIANecessityStatus=]</li>
      <li>Conducting the DPIA to identify risks and impacts: the activity is [=DPIAProcedure=] and its output is denoted using [=DPIARiskStatus=]</li>
      <li>Determining the outcome based on risk mitigation: the activity is [=DPIAOutcome=] and its output is denoted using [=DPIAOutcomeStatus=]</li>
      <li>Determining whether processing should be permitted to continue or be carried out, with the outcome being denote using [=DPIAProcessingRecommendation=]</li>
      <li>Assessing whether processing is carried out in conformance with the DPIA, with the outcome being denoted using [=DPIAConformity=]</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In addition to DPV's concepts for representing information about processing of personal data, EU-GDPR also recommends using [[[DCT]]] concepts to represent <a href="#external-concepts">relevant metadata</a>, such as dates, identifiers, validity, etc.</p>

  <section id="vocab-data-breach">
    <h2>Data Breach</h2>
    <p>[[GDPR]] defines several obligations regarding the handling of data breach incidents, and authoritative guidance establishes the categories of data breach based on how it affects data. To support implementation of these, the [[EU-GDPR]] extension provides concepts that extend the [[DPV]] to define GDPR specific requirements.</p>
    <p>[=DataBreach=] is a specific concept that reflects the GDPR's definition of data breaches, and is separate from a general data breach incident (such as that defined within the [[RISK]] extension) in terms of its involvement of personal data as well the use of GDPR 'processing' definition. Under GDPR, data breaches are categorised based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security#Key_concepts">CIA information security model</a> as [=ConfidentialityBreach=] for disclosures e.g. accidentally sharing data, [=IntegrityBreach=] for alterations e.g. maliciously overwriting data, and [=AvailabilityBreach=] for loss or destruction e.g. erasing all data on disk. In addition to these, GDPR also requires awareness of when a breach affects multiple jurisdictions either due to involvement of data subjects from multiple EU countries or because the processing of personal data involves multiple locations spread across EU. Such breaches are categorised as [=CrossBorderDataBreach=].</p>
    <aside class="note" title="Guidance on documenting data breaches">
      <p>The DPVCG is working on the [[[GUIDE-GDPR-DataBreach]]] which will provide guidance and examples for representing information about data breaches as well as their relevant reporting and notification documentation based on the use of incident management concepts defined in the [[RISK]] extension.</p>
    </aside>
    <p>[=DataBreachNotice=] represents the communication of information regarding a data breach to another entity, such as reporting it to the authority or sending communications to data subjects. Specific notice concepts are defined to reflect the recipients, for example [=ControllerBreachNotice=] is a notice sent to the controller and [=DataSubjectBreachNotice=] is a notice sent to the data subject. For reporting data breaches to authorities, there are multiple types of notifications at various stages of investigations - these are represented by [=DPABreachNotice=] with additional concepts for initial notice sent within 72 hours, as well as 'phased' notices which are sent as information becomes available.</p>
    <p>To represent status of GDPR obligations regarding data breach notifications, the concept [=DataBreachNoticeRequirement=] provides specific outcomes which can be documented. For example, [=BreachNotificationNotNeeded=] indicates that notifications are not needed, and [=DPABreachNotificationNeeded=] represents a notification to the authority is needed.</p>
    <p>To support the documentation of data breaches, the concept [=DataBreachReport=] represents a report associated with the breach, which can contain information on how the breach was discovered, the duration and coverage of the breach, what measures were taken to handle it, and what notifications were sent as part of the data breach handling processes. Specific concepts are provided to represent different reports required for fulfilling GDPR requirements, for example [=DataBreachDetectionReport=] as a report regarding the detection of a data breach and [=DataBreachPreliminaryReport=] as a preliminary report (e.g. within 72 hours) when an investigation is underway.</p>
    <p>GDPR also requires carrying out an impact assessment to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach, in particular on the processing of personal data and on the rights and freedoms of the data subjects. To represent this, the concept [=DBIARiskStatus=] is provided with specific outcomes. For example, [=DBIAIndicatesHighRisk=] indicates the data breach has a 'high-risk' status.</p>

    <h2>Establishment and Authorities</h2>
    <section id="vocab-entities-establishment">
      <h3>Establishment</h3>
      <p>The concept 'establishment' is defined in the GPDR in Article 4-16 as 'main establishment' which is used to determine who will be the 'lead' supervisory authority responsible. An establishment in this context can be a subsidiary, a division or branch, or other forms of corporate structures through which multi-national corporations and organisations operate. To support representation of this, [[EU-GDPR]] defines the concept [=Establishment=], and extends it as [=MainEstablishment=] to indicate which establishment is the 'main'. To indicate that there is only a single establishment and no other locations are involved, the concept [=SingleEstablishment=] is provided.</p>
      <p>Establishments are indicated by using the relation [=hasEstablishment=]. Main establishment is associated by using the relation [=isMainEstablishmentFor=], or the main establishment can be indicated using [=hasMainEstablishment=]. To represent organisation structures such as subsidiaries, the relation <code>dpv:hasSubsidiary</code> and <code>dpv:isSubsidiaryOf</code> can be reused.</p>
      <aside class="example" title="Indicating Main Establishment of Organisation for GDPR">
        <p>This example shows the use of EU-GDPR to represent the main and other establishments associated with an organisation. The example uses CompanyX, established in the USA, as a fictional company which is headquartered in Ireland as X-IE and has subsidiaries in Netherlands (X-NL) and Luxembourg (X-LU). The main establishment for CompanyX in EU is X-IE.

      <h3>Authorities</h3>
      <p>GDPR has a cross-border procedure for handling of compliance and investigations as the authorities are defined at a national level (in addition to supra- and intra- authorities). As part of this, an investigation involving multiple authorities requires establishing which authority is the 'lead' with the others categorised as 'concerned' authorities. The 'lead' authority may be different from the 'local' authority which is defined based on where the organisation is established or has its main establishment. To represent these cases, the [[EU-GDPR]] defines [=LeadSupervisoryAuthority=], [=ConcernedSupervisoryAuthority=], and [=LocalSupervisoryAuthority=] concepts. To associate them, the relations [=hasLeadSA=], [=hasConcernedSA=], and [=hasLocalSA=] are provided.</p>
      <aside class="example" title="Indicating lead and concerned supervisory authorities for a data breach investigation">
        <p>This example shows the use of EU-GDPR extension to represent involvement of authorities in a 'lead' and 'concerned' role for a data breach incident. The data breach is associated with CompanyX as the data controller, and the Irish DPA is both the lead and local authority with the German DPA also involved. The declaration of DPAs uses the extensions LEGAL-IE for Ireland and LEGAL-DE for Germany.</p>

    <h2>Compliance</h2>
    <p>The concepts in this section reflect the status of processing operations being in <i>compliance with GDPR</i>, by extending the <code>ComplianceStatus</code> from DPV for GDPR. It does not define the requirements for compliance itself. To indicate these, the relation <code>dpv:hasLawfulness</code> can be used.</p>
    <aside class="example" title="Indicating status of GDPR lawfulness">
      <p>This example shows the use of EU-GDPR to indicate the state of GDPR lawfulness associated with two processes. The first is asserted to be compliant, while the compliance status for the second is unknown at the moment. Both processes assert the applicability of GDPR for brevity.</p>
