    <p>The Justification extension provides a taxonomy extending the [[[DPV]]] concept <code>Justification</code> to enable representing specific justifications associated with non-fulfilment, non-requirement, delays, and exercising reasons involved in processes. The namespace for terms in justifications is <a href="http://www.w3id.org/dpv/justifications#"><code>https://www.w3id.org/dpv/justifications#</code></a>, the suggested prefix  is <code>justifications</code>, and the justifications vocabulary and its documentation is available on <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv">GitHub</a>.</p>

  <section id="motivation">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>DPV provides the concept <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#Justification"><code>Justification</code></a> and relation <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#hasJustification"><code>hasJustification</code></a> to provide reasons or explanations in specific contexts. For example, where a right could not be fulfilled due to the identity of the individual not being established or where a request was deemed as being too excessive and burdensome to undertake. Justifications also represent reasons why a process must be undertaken, for example why a particular objection is being made or why a specific activity is asked to be undertaken. To support the expression of such specific justifications, this extension provides concepts extending <code>dpv:Justification</code>.</p>
    <p>Justifications can be found in regulations as exceptions to obligations - for example in GDPR Article 12-5 the justification "requests ... are manifestly unfounded or excessive" is mentioned. Justifications can also be identified through practical applications and use-cases, such as where organisations and data subjects commonly need to state reasons or explanations. As such, the DPVCG strives to provide a rich and comprehensive taxonomy of justifications and welcomes contributions for the same.</p>
    {{ example_aside('dex:E0061') }}
    <aside class="note" title="Associating justifications with regulations, e.g., GDPR">
      <p>This extension does not provide any association or indication of the use of justifications towards regulatory requirements, nor provide knowledge of where justifications can be used within specific regulatory obligations. Such associations and knowledge should be provided within the respective extensions for that regulation, e.g., [[EU-GDPR]] extension for [[GDPR]].</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section id="vocab-justificaitons">
    <h2>Justification Types</h2>
    <p>Justifications are broadly categorised as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>NotRequiredJustification</code>: Justification to reject or not complete a process as it is not required or is not applicable</li>
      <li><code>NonFulfilmentJustification</code>: Justification for not fulfilling a process or requirement or obligation</li>
      <li><code>DelayJustification</code>: Justification to delay a process</li>
      <li><code>ExerciseJustification</code>: Justification for why the process should be carried out</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This categorisation is not exact and mutually exclusive, but is provided as a convenience to organise the concepts in a comprehensible hierarchy. For example, a justification concept declared as <code>DelayJustification</code> can still be used as a <code>NonFulfilmentJustification</code> within a use-case.</p>

    <section id="vocab-justifications-notrequired">
      <h3>Not-Required</h3>
