  <section id="abstract">
    <p>The EU-DGA extension extends the [[[DPV]]] to provide concepts such as entities, rights, and other relevant concepts based on the [[[DGA]]]. The canonical URL for the EU-DGA extension is <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv/legal/eu/dga">https://w3id.org/dpv/legal/eu/dga</a>, the namespace for EU-DGA terms is <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv/legal/eu/dga#"><code>https://w3id.org/dpv/legal/eu/dga#</code></a>, the suggested prefix is <code>eu-dga</code>, and this document along with source and releases are available at <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv">https://github.com/w3c/dpv</a>.</p>
    <p>This work was first presented in the article "<a href="https://doi.org/10.3233/SSW230015"><i>Semantics for Implementing Data Reuse and Altruism under EU's Data Governance Act</i></a>" by Beatriz Esteves, Victor Rodriguez Doncel, Harshvardhan J. Pandit, and Dave Lewis.</p>

  <section id="motivation">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This extension provides concepts relevant for the implementation of EU's [[[DGA]]]. The DGA promotes availability of data and encourages its sharing and reuse through novel mechanisms such as 'data intermediaries' and 'data altruism'. It also provides specific rights, and requires implementation details such as specific technical measures in order to ensure such sharing and altruistic (re-)uses of data are compliant with existing regulations, such as [[GDPR]], and respect rights and freedoms.</p>
    <aside class="note" title="Extending the DGA vocabulary">
      <p>The DPVCG welcomes contributions and discussion on how this extension can be further enhanced and expanded to realise the goals of the DGA.</p>
    </aside>
    <p>This extension provides the following concepts defined or required by the DGA:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#vocab-entities">Entities</a></li>
      <li><a href="#vocab-legal-basis">Legal Bases</a></li>
      <li><a href="#vocab-legal-rights">Rights</a></li>

    <section id="vocab-entities">
    <h2>Entities</h2>
    <p>Entities in the [[DGA]] are defined by extending the <code>dpv:LegalEntity</code> concept, and are associated with using the relation <code>dpv:hasEntity</code>. DGA's entities are different from 'legal roles' in GDPR's use of 'controllers' and 'processors' as the DGA entities are established with a specific role and purpose. For example, a 'Data Co-operative' is a legal entity which is established to provide the data co-operative services - namely for intermediation and exercise of rights.</p>
    <aside class="note" title="Associating entities in context">
      <p>We are discussing the addition of specific relations to associate entities with processes, e.g. <code>hasDataHolder</code> based on the evolving DGA implementations and authoritative guidance.</p>
    </aside>
    
    {{ list_hierarchy(modules['entities']['classes']) }}
  </section>

    <section id="vocab-legal-basis">
    <h2>Legal Bases</h2>
    <p>Legal bases in the [[DGA]] relate to specific activities such as processing of non-personal data ([=A2-6-Permission=]) and data transfers ([=A5-12-Adequacy-Decision=]). These are defined by extending <code>dpv:LegalBasis</code> and its subtypes, and are indicated by using the relation <code>dpv:hasLegalBasis</code>.</p>
    {{ list_hierarchy(modules['legal_basis']['classes']) }}
    </section>

  <section id="vocab-legal-rights">
    <h2>Rights under DGA</h2>
    <p>The [[DGA]] provides several rights to the data subject and data holders whose applicability depends on the context and nature of processing taking place. Since these rights are applicable for both data subjects and non-data subjects (data holders), they are represented by extending <code>dpv:Right</code> instead of <code>dpv:DataSubjectRight</code>. To indicate a right is applicable or available, the relation <code>dpv:hasRight</code> is used.</p>

    {{ list_hierarchy(modules['legal_rights']['classes']) }}
  </section>

  <section id="vocab-services">
    <h2>Services</h2>
    <p>The [[DGA]] defines and regulates several 'services', such as those for data intermediation and altruism. To represent these, the concept <code>dpv:Service</code> is extended. Services can be associated using the relation <code>dpv:hasService</code>.</p>
    
    {{ list_hierarchy(modules['services']['classes']) }}
  </section>

  <section id="vocab-registers">
    <h2>Registers</h2>
    <p>The [[DGA]] requires the creation and maintenance of specific registers or registries, such as those for data altruistic organisations. These are represented by extending the concept <code>dpv:PublicRegisterOfEntities</code>. Membership of the registry can be expressed using the concept <code>dpv:hasEntity</code>, or even through use of [[SKOS]] collections.</p>
    
    {{ list_hierarchy(modules['registers']['classes']) }}
  </section>

  <section id="vocab-toms">
    <h2>Tech/Org Measures</h2>
    <p>The specific technical and organisational measures defined or implied in the [[DGA]] are defined by extending the <code>dpv:TechnicalOrganisationalMeasure</code> concepts. These can be associated by using the relations <code>dpv:hasTechnicalMeasure</code> and <code>dpv:hasOrganisationalMeasure</code>. In addition to these, if a measure has legal enforcement, then the concept <code>dpv:LegalMeasure</code> and relation <code>dpv:hasLegalMeasure</code> can be used.</p>
