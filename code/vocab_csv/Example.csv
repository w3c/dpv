E0003,Extending Purpose for Use-Case,"DPV defines the (broad) concept Marketing in its Purpose hierarchy to represent information about (purposes related to) marketing activities and topics. For a use-case which requires representing purposes (note: plural) related to marketing of new products, the broad Marketing concept is extended as a child or subclass concept for representing the intended purpose as, e.g. MarketingNewProducts.",E0003.ttl,ttl,file,dpv:Purpose,,accepted,2022-10-13,Harsh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
E0004,DPV-OWL: Extending Purpose for Use-Case,"DPV defines the (broad) concept Marketing in its Purpose hierarchy to represent information about (purposes related to) marketing activities and topics.

E0005,Combining concepts to indicate they always occur together,"Consider the use-case where an activity simultaneously uses the data while collecting it. The first representation (<code>ActivityA</code>) models them separately - which is not accurate as it is ambiguous in terms of collection and usage taking place independently. By extending the collect and use concepts to create a new concept called <code>CollectAndUse</code>, it is possible to accurately declare that they both occur as a concurrent operation. Such combinations of concepts are also useful to collectively represent or annotate additional information such as: technologies involved, implementation details, or agents involved",E0005.ttl,ttl,file,dpv:Processing,,accepted,2022-10-13,Harsh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
E0006,Maintaining Interoperability between Use-Cases,"For example, two TV companies (<code>AliceCo</code> and <code>BobCo</code>) extend the concept <code>Optimisation</code> to reflect their respective purposes. When exchanging information about their use-cases with each other (or with a third party), by following the chain of use-case specific concepts it is possible to deduce that both <code>AliceCo</code> and <code>BobCo</code> are doing optimisations for consumers. Thus a common language or interface can be developed based on using DPV as a point of interoperability and commonality which can be used by adopters to define the specifics of their use-case. For example, in the above use-case, a common notice generation algorithm could be created and used to inform users of both services the purposes each company is using data for.",E0006.ttl,ttl,file,dpv:Purpose,,accepted,2022-10-13,Harsh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
E0007,Use of PersonalDataHandling to group how data is being processed,"For an example of how <code>PersonalDataHandling</code> brings together the core concepts, consider the example where <code>Acme</code> is a <code>DataController</code> that <code>Collect</code>(s) and <code>Use</code>(s) <code>Email</code> for <code>ServiceProvision</code>.",E0007.ttl,ttl,file,dpv:PersonalDataHandling,,accepted,2022-10-13,Harsh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
E0008,Nesting PersonalDataHandling for modular expression of processing operations,"onsider the example where <em>Acme</em>, as a <em>DataController</em>, maintains records of its processing activities using <code>PersonalDataHandling</code> to represent one of its services. In this, it collects email, uses it for internal analyses based on <em>LegitimateInterests</em>, and also sends marketing information by using a processor based on the data subject's consent. Using nesting of personal data handling, the information can be expressed at granular level representing service, individual purposes, and so on.",E0008.ttl,ttl,file,dpv:PersonalDataHandling,,accepted,2022-10-13,Harsh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
E0009,Adding human-readable descriptions,"In this example, a new purpose is created by extending <code>dpv:FraudPreventionAndDetection</code> and annotated with human-readable information. The interpretation of this purpose is thus more clear in relation to how it is applied or used within that use-case, and also serves to compare it with other purposes within the same category.",E0009.ttl,ttl,file,dpv:Purpose,,accepted,2022-10-13,Harsh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
E0010,Using NACE codes to restrict Purposes,"For example, the following purpose concerns implementing access control with the domain specified as scientific research using its corresponding NACE code <code>M72</code> to indicate sectorial implications for what ""access control"" and ""enforce security"" are expected to imply.",E0010.ttl,ttl,file,"dpv:Purpose,dpv:Sector",,accepted,2022-10-13,Harsh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

E0012,Data Sources,"Data sources can be the data subject (direct or indirect), the data controller or processor (itself), or another entity (third party). The below example provides an overview of these with distinctions between source and method of generation.",E0012.ttl,ttl,file,dpv:DataSource,,accepted,2022-10-13,Harsh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
E0013,Automated Processing with Human Involvement,"Consider the use of a spam filter that is based on automated processing operations where humans provide inputs, have oversight of the operation, and results in automated decision making for whether communications should be propogated. A new separate filter is developed that utilises a novel spam detection criteria that also takes into account communications other than emails for the sender and makes automated decisions whether to permit communication to proceed. Such explicit annotation of several high-risk operations assists in performing impact assessments for this technology, as well as understanding the extent and effectiveness of human involvement to mitigate risks and issues.",E0013.ttl,ttl,file,dpv:Automation,,accepted,2022-10-13,Harsh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
E0014,Derivation and inference of personal data,"This use-case collects browser fingerprint and IP Address to identify the country one is visiting from, and to infer language to be used for personalisation.

E0015,Indicating personal data is sensitive or special category,"In this example, the knowledge that blood samples are of type 'special category' can be inferred from the fact that they are a form of <i>Medical Health</i> which is a 'special category'. However, the example considers best practices that suggest explicitly identifying and denoting that blood samples are also of type 'special category'.",E0015.ttl,ttl,file,"dpv:SpecialCategoryPersonalData,dpv:SensitivePersonalData",,accepted,2022-10-13,Harsh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
E0016,Protecting data using encryption and access control,"To indicate data is encrypted using the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)"">Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) method</a>, one would extend the <a href=""https://www.w3id.org/dpv#Encryption""><code>Encryption</code></a> concept within DPV to represent <code>RSA</code>, and then instantiate it with the specific implementation used (e.g. to indicate key size). Access to this data is further restricted by requiring a password or credential.",E0016.ttl,ttl,file,"dpv:Encryption,dpv:AccessControlMethod",,accepted,2022-10-13,Harsh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
E0017,Indicating staff training for use of Credentials,"To indicate staff are trained in the use of credentials, and that a policy exists regarding this, the use of <code>OrganisationalMeasure</code> concepts can be combined in several ways. Note that the interpretations for how staff training is associated with credentials, or contains training regarding credentials is arbitrary in notation. It is intended to demonstrate how different perspectives can be represented so as to be suitable to the organisation's documentation practices.",E0017.ttl,ttl,file,"dpv:StaffTraining,dpv:Policy",,accepted,2022-10-13,Harsh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
E0018,Notice used in an activity,This example first specifies a privacy notice as a document is being used in the context of a service as represented using a personal data handling instance.

E0019,Consent record,"This example shows a consent record containing the topic of consent (i.e. which processing activities it was about), its current status, and when it was given by the data subject. The structure of a record is highly dependant on the requirements of the use-case, and can vary across implementations. In this case, it is based on a draft of the ISO/IEC AWI TS 27560 Privacy technologies - Consent record information structure.",E0019.ttl,ttl,file,"dpv:ConsentRecord,dpv:PersonalDataHandling,dpv:Consent,dpv:DataController,dpv:Jurisdiction,dpv:Recipient,dpv:ConsentStatus,dpv:ConsentType,dpv:Duration",,accepted,2022-10-13,Harsh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

E0022,Denoting Legal Basis,"The <code>LegalBasis</code> can be associated with any concept using the relation <code>hasLegalBasis</code>. Such associations are of three types: (1) where the legal basis refers to an instance, such as the consent or contract associated with a particular data subject; (2) where the legal basis refers to the category that will be used to justify processing, such as the concept <i>consent</i> to denote consent will be the basis for indicated processing; and lastly (3) where the legal basis is the denoted with context, such as <i>consent of service consumers</i>.",E0022.ttl,ttl,file,"dpv:LegalBasis,dpv:PersonalDataHandling,dpv:Consent",,accepted,2022-10-13,Harsh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
E0023,Consent as legal basis,"Here, a personal data handling instance represents some context (e.g. a service, or a product, or some opreation), and the example specifies that the legal basis for these is the use of consent.",E0023.ttl,ttl,file,"dpv:LegalBasis,dpv:Consent",,accepted,2022-10-13,Harsh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
E0024,Details of Consent,"In this example, an individual's consent is recorded with abstraction in the form of linking to a common personal data handling instance from the previous example. This 'common' personal data handling represents processing taking place for all data subjects, whereas the consent instance refers only to the individual with a link to this common information. This is to present an alternative method for storing information as compared to extensive consent records.",E0024.ttl,ttl,file,"dpv:Consent,dpv:ConsentStatus,dpv:ConsentType",,accepted,2022-10-13,Harsh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

E0028,Contextual Necessity,"In this example, a <code>PersonalDataHandling</code> instance is comprised of two nested <code>PersonalDataHandling</code> instances for each of the optional and required parts. The personal data category 'Account Identifier' is indicated as being required for 'Communication for Customer Care', while the use of 'Email' is optional for the same purpose.",E0028.ttl,ttl,file,"dpv:Context,dpv:Necessity,dpv:PersonalDataHandling",,accepted,2022-10-13,Harsh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
E0029,Risk and Consequence,"In this example, we consider <i>Risk</i> can be associated with any concept given its broad existence and applicability, and that its mitigation is a technical and organisational measure. Using this, the implemented or adopted technical and organisational measures within an use-case are annotated with the risks they address or mitigate, along with specific impacts that may occur if the risk were to occur. For example, the storage of personal data within a database has an implementation of access control that mitigates the consequence of unauthorised access and its impact to cause harm.",E0029.ttl,ttl,file,"dpv:Risk,dpv:Consequence,dpv:Impact,dpv:Harm,dpv:RiskMitigationMeasure",,accepted,2022-10-13,Harsh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
