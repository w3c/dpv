Intended Use can involve any concept e.g. DPV's purpose, processing, tech/org measures, and can be low-level purely technical uses such as store data or high-level goals such as legal compliance. Intended Use only describes the intent or ex-ante intention, and may be different from how the technology is being actually used - which is indicated by using isImplementedUsingTechnology in a process or other relevant context.
