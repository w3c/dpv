AI,Artificial Intelligence (AI),"A technical and scientific field devoted to the engineered system that generates outputs such as content, forecasts, recommendations or decisions for a given set of human-defined objectives",dpv:Technology,sc,,,,,ISO/IEC 22989:2022,2024-04-28,,accepted,Delaram Golpayegani,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AISystem,AI System,"An engineered system that generates outputs such as content, forecasts, recommendations or decisions for a given set of human-defined objectives (ISO/IEC 22989:2022 definition); or A machine-based system that, for explicit or implicit objectives, infers, from the input it receives, how to generate outputs such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical or virtual environments. Different AI systems vary in their levels of autonomy and adaptiveness after deployment (OECD 2024 definition); or A machine-based system demonstrating varying degrees of autonomy and adaptiveness after deployment, generating outputs such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions to influence physical or virtual environments (EU Vocabularies' AI Taxonomy definition)","ai:AI,tech:System",sc,,,,,"OECD.AI, ISO/IEC 22989:2022",2024-05-17,,accepted,Delaram Golpayegani,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Technique,Technique,"The underlying technological algorithm, method, or process that forms the technique for using or applying AI",ai:AI,sc,,,,This concept refers to the foundational computational implementation and is necessary to distinguish the 'algorithm' (ai:Technique) from the 'application' (ai:Capability) and 'goal' (dpv:Purpose),,2024-04-28,,accepted,Delaram Golpayegani,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Capability,Capability,Capability or use of AI to achieve a technical goal or objective,ai:AI,sc,,,,"This concept refers to the application of an AI technique to achieve a technical goal or function, and is necessary to distinguish the 'algorithm' (ai:Technique) from the 'application' (ai:Capability) and 'goal' (dpv:Purpose)",,2024-04-28,,accepted,Delaram Golpayegani,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AIProcess,AI Process,A process involving AI technologies,dpv:Process,sc,,,,This concept provides a convenient method to indicate AI is involved (somewhere) within the Process,,,,accepted,Harshvardhan J. Pandit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GenAI,Generative AI,"Use of artificial intelligence models that can learn from and mimic large amounts of data to create content such as text, images, music, videos, code, and more, based on inputs or prompts",ai:AI,sc,,,,,"(AI Taxonomy - EU Vocabularies,http://data.europa.eu/8s8/ai-taxonomy)",2025-12-17,,accepted,"Delaram Golpayegani, Harshvardhan J.

AIAgent,AI Agent,"An AI Agent, also known as an 'intelligent agent', is a software agent that utilises AI technologies","ai:AI,tech:SoftwareAgent",sc,,,,"Other definitions of AI Agents may include the perception of environment as some capacity to incorporate the environment through sensors (e.g. computer vision) or data (e.g. web environments), and to produce changes in outputs through some degree of autonomy (i.e. without human intervention). The definition of 'AI Agent' provided in this extension relaxes such requirements and instead focuses on classifying these agents based solely on their use of AI technologies to allow compatibility with the evolving definitions",,2025-10-28,,accepted,Harshvardhan J.
