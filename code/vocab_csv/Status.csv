To express such interpretations, further concepts should be expanded from this base concept",,2025-06-19,,accepted,"Harshvardhan J. Pandit, Georg P. Krog, Beatriz Esteves, Delaram Golpayegani, Julian Flake, Arthit Suriyawongkul",
PrimaryUse,Primary Use,Concept indicating compatibility based on the use being either the original context or something that is compatible with it,,dpv:ReuseCompatibility,,,,"Primary Use refers to an assessment where two contexts are found to be compatible, e.g. if purpose is used to test compatibility, then for two activities the second activity is said be the primary use if its purpose is compatible with the first activity's purpose",,2025-06-19,,accepted,"Harshvardhan J.

For example, in healthcare settings, reusing data from patients for medical research is considered secondary use, however, it still occurs within the aegis and duties of the hospital and therefore is different from cases where another external for-profit company is reusing the data (which is represented as Tertiary Use)",,2025-06-19,,proposed,"Harshvardhan J.

TertiaryUse,Tertiary Use,Concept indicating incompatibility that goes beyond some established parameters or norms to the extent that it is considered tertiary or completely removed or detached from the initial primary use,dpv:SecondaryUse,dpv:ReuseCompatibility,,,,"Tertiary Use is useful to indicate that the incompatibility is to such a degree that it should not be considered mere secondary use of the data and should be further distinguished from it. For example, in healthcare, reusing data from patients for medical research is considered secondary use, but if the same data is being used by external third parties who have no relation to the patients and are not using it for public good, then it can be considered as a Tertiary Use. This concept is intended to be analogous to ""Third Party"" in privacy contexts",,2025-06-19,,proposed,"Harshvardhan J. Pandit, Georg P.
