For example, in healthcare settings, reusing data from patients for medical research is considered secondary use, however, it still occurs within the aegis and duties of the hospital and therefore is different from cases where another external for-profit company is reusing the data (which is represented as Tertiary Use)",,2025-06-19,,proposed,"Harshvardhan J.

For example, in healthcare, reusing data from patients for medical research is considered secondary use, but if the same data is being used by external third parties who have no relation to the patients and are not using it for public good, then it can be considered as a Tertiary Use. This concept is intended to be analogous to ""Third Party"" in privacy contexts",,2025-06-19,,proposed,"Harshvardhan J. Pandit, Georg P.
