ProactiveControl,Proactive Control,Control that is established or functions before an event occurs,,risk:RiskControl,,,,The use of 'proactive' here refers to this control being established to address events before they occur. It does not indicate putting in place controls before the event such as planning ahead for potential use of controls to respond to an incident,,2025-01-06,,accepted,Harshvardhan J. Pandit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MonitorControl,Monitor Control,Control that monitors for the occurrence of an event,risk:ProactiveControl,risk:RiskControl,,,,"Monitoring is a broad term that refers to identifying information about an event, including its occurrence, characteristics such as severity or specific contextual metrics, affected things and entities, and having the ability to obtain and use this information to address the event. Monitoring is also used to refer to the activities associated with ensuring controls are active and effective. For this reason, specific concepts are defined which extend this control to express explicit actions included in the general use of 'monitoring' in risk management",,2024-05-19,2025-01-06,modified,Harshvardhan J.

DetectionControl,Detection Control,Control that detects an event,risk:MonitorControl,risk:RiskControl,,,,"Detection refers to the observation, derivation, inference, or any other method for drawing conclusions that an event has occurred or is likely to occur with a given certainty. For controls that identify information about the event in terms of metrics or characteristics, see risk:IdentificationControl",,2024-05-19,2025-01-06,modified,"Delaram Golpayegani, Harshvardhan J. Pandit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
IdentificationControl,Identification Control,Control that identifies the characteristics of an event,risk:MonitorControl,risk:RiskControl,,,,"Identification in the context of an event refers to its characteristics such as likelihood, severity, as well as contextual metrics such as amount of data or power being used, or affected entities or things, and which can be used to categorise the event in terms of risk level or other contextual groupings",,2024-05-19,2025-01-06,modified,"Delaram Golpayegani, Harshvardhan J. Pandit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LoggingControl,Logging Control,Control that logs an event,risk:MonitorControl,risk:RiskControl,,,,"Log refers to a record of information regarding the event, including whether it has occurred, was prevented from occurring, and any actions or processes taken in response to it or resulting from it",,2025-01-06,,accepted,"Delaram Golpayegani, Harshvardhan J. Pandit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TransparencyControl,Transparency Control,Control that provides information about an event,risk:MonitorControl,risk:RiskControl,,,,"Transparency refers to the availability of information, whether for the same or different entity in relation to who establishes and operates the control, and where transparency implies having the means to obtain and use information about an event",,2025-01-06,,accepted,"Delaram Golpayegani, Harshvardhan J. Pandit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
OversightControl,Oversight Control,Control that provides oversight for an event in terms of having information about it and being able to supervise or manage it,risk:MonitorControl,risk:RiskControl,,,,"Oversight can be ambiguously used in terms of having knowledge about an event (see risk:TransparencyControl instead), or being able to identify when it occurs (see risk:DetectionControl instead). The control defined by this concept includes the ability to act on the event as part of the 'oversight' term used in management",,2025-01-06,,accepted,Harshvardhan J. Pandit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AvoidanceControl,Avoidance Control,Control that avoids an event with the goal of removing it completely,risk:ProactiveControl,risk:RiskControl,,,,"Avoiding is distinct from Mitigation and Modification as the goal to avoid an event is to prevent it from occurring at all, whereas mitigation and modification accept an event will occur and focus on managing it",,2025-01-06,,accepted,Harshvardhan J. Pandit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EliminationControl,Elimination Control,Control that eliminates an event entirely such that the event does not occur,risk:AvoidanceControl,risk:RiskControl,,,,Elimination requires the event's likelihood to be reduced to zero such that the event cannot occur in the context. This can be done by establishing methods to prevent the event from occurring (e.g. gatekeeping filters) or by changing the underlying context (e.g. replacing faulty device). The difference between risk:ModificationControl and risk:EliminationControl is that modification works to change the event characteristics whereas elimination works on the context to prevent the event,,2025-01-06,,accepted,"Delaram Golpayegani, Harshvardhan J. Pandit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SubstitutionControl,Substitution Control,Control that substitutes an event with another such that the initial event no longer takes place while the substituted event takes place in place of it,risk:AvoidanceControl,risk:RiskControl,,,,"Substitution implies that the replacement event is less risky or is more safe than the replaced event, which is distinct from elimination where no event occurs and thus there is an elimination of risk entirely",,2025-01-06,,accepted,"Delaram Golpayegani, Harshvardhan J. Pandit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ModificationControl,Modification Control,Control that modifies the context to change the event's characteristics such that the event still occurs but with the modified characteristics with the goal of managing an event that is accepted to occur,risk:ProactiveControl,risk:RiskControl,,,,"Modification necessitates a change in the context to result in a change in the event's characteristics. Where such changes reduce the likelihood or effects of the event, the modification also works as a mitigation for the event",,2025-01-06,,accepted,"Delaram Golpayegani, Harshvardhan J. Pandit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MitigationControl,Mitigation Control,Control that aims to reduce the likelihood or effect of an event with the goal of managing an event accepted to occur,risk:ProactiveControl,risk:RiskControl,,,,"Mitigation requires accepting that an event will occur, and thereby focusing on managing it by reducing its likelihood or effects by adding additional processes to specifically address the event or its effects",,2025-01-06,,accepted,"Delaram Golpayegani, Harshvardhan J. Pandit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ReactiveControl,Reactive Control,Control that is established or functions after an event occurs,,risk:RiskControl,,,,The use of 'reactive' here refers to this control being established i.e. becoming active to address the effects of an event after they occur. It does not imply that the controls are put in place after the event or that there is no planned procedure for handling an incident,,2025-01-06,,accepted,Harshvardhan J. Pandit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ReductionControl,Reduction Control,Control that reduces the effects of an event,risk:ReactiveControl,risk:RiskControl,,,,"Reduction here refers to a lessening of the effects after the event has occurred by either reducing their likelihood or their severity in the context. This can involve changing the underlying context such that the effects have a reduced chance of occurring, or to create additional measures such that the effects do not have the initial severity for an entity",,2024-05-19,2025-01-06,modified,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

InterruptionControl,Interruption Control,Control that interrupts an event without removing the possibility for it to be resumed and where the aim is to stop the event,risk:ReductionControl,risk:RiskControl,,,,"Interruption refers to the event being temporarily halted, such as an emergency measure while further suitable measures are identified and put in place. To indicate stopping the event completely rather than a temporary interruption, see risk:RemediationControl which fixes the underlying issue and risk:EliminationControl which prevents the event from occurring",,2025-01-06,,accepted,"Delaram Golpayegani, Harshvardhan J. Pandit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
InterventionControl,Intervention Control,Control that intervenes in the operations of the event to change some context with the aim of changing the event or the effects,risk:ReductionControl,risk:RiskControl,,,,"Intervention implies taking steps to resolve the effects or to prevent further escalation while the event is still ongoing. For halting the event, see risk:InterruptionControl, for recovering and undoing the effects, see risk:RecoveryControl and risk:ReversalControl. Intervention is a temporary or stop-gap measure which is used while the event is ongoing to prevent it from escalating or creating additional issues",,2025-01-06,,accepted,Harshvardhan J. Pandit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ContainmentControl,Containment Control,Control that aims to contain the event in terms of limiting its occurrence or effects,risk:ReductionControl,risk:RiskControl,,,,"Containment implies either changing the event or the context such that the event's effects are restricted, such as by establishing a physical or digital boundary within which the effects can occur or to prevent the effects from affecting things inside the boundary",,2024-05-19,2025-01-06,modified,"Delaram Golpayegani, Harshvardhan J. Pandit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
OverrideControl,Override Control,Control that aims to override the event with the goal of avoiding its further effects,risk:ReactiveControl,risk:RiskControl,,,,"Override indicates a (temporary) change or bypassing of usual processes, controls, and measures in response to an event",,2025-01-06,,accepted,"Delaram Golpayegani, Harshvardhan J. Pandit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
InvestigationControl,Investigation Control,Control that identifies information through an investigative process about an event and its effects after it has occurred,risk:ReactiveControl,risk:RiskControl,,,,"Investigative controls are used to identify information about an event and its effects which can be used to identify further effective measures to address them, and to identify processes to remedy and recover from it. Investigation control therefore is focused on analysis of an event after its occurrence with the goal of identifying applicability and effectiveness of other controls to address it",,2025-01-06,,accepted,Harshvardhan J. Pandit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ResolutionControl,Resolution Control,Control that aims to resolve an event's effects with the goal of fixing or recovering from it,risk:ReactiveControl,risk:RiskControl,,,,,,2025-01-06,,accepted,Harshvardhan J. Pandit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RecoveryControl,Recovery Control,Control that aims to restore the context following an event,risk:ResolutionControl,risk:RiskControl,,,,"Recovery implies taking steps to correct the effects which may not be the same as the initial conditions before the event, whereas risk:ReversalControl refers to undoing the effects such that the initial condition is restored",,2024-05-19,2025-01-06,modified,"Delaram Golpayegani, Harshvardhan J. Pandit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RemediationControl,Remediation Control,Control that aims to fix or remedy the causes of an event to prevent further occurrences,risk:ResolutionControl,risk:RiskControl,,,,"Remediation involves making changes in the context to avoid further events and effects, which may be for the specific event or for other similar events and effects. As such, remediation can also be undertaken as a proactive measure in the risk management lifecycle following an incident",,2024-05-19,2025-08-06,modified,"Delaram Golpayegani, Harshvardhan J. Pandit, Arthit Suriyawongkul",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ReversalControl,Reversal Control,Control that aims to reverse or undo the effects of an event,risk:ResolutionControl,risk:RiskControl,,,,Reversal can be achieved through measures such as restoring information from a backup or replacing things such that the initial context not containing the event's effects is restored,,2025-01-06,,accepted,"Delaram Golpayegani, Harshvardhan J. Pandit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TransferControl,Transfer Control,Control that aims to transfer the event (or risk) to another context or entity,,risk:RiskControl,,,,"Transfer implies moving (physically or logically) the event to another context or entity. While Risk Management methods indicate risk transfer as occurring between entities, this concept is defined more broadly by including 'context or entity' so as to enable modelling cases where the transfer takes place between processes - which may be managed by the same or different entity. Additionally, typical use of 'Transfer' implies a formal mechanism such as an agreement, which is absent from this concept. If only partial responsibility is transferred, such as for a specific measure, then this can be considered as an instance of sharing the risk - for which risk:ShareControl is provided",,2025-01-06,,accepted,Harshvardhan J. Pandit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ShareControl,Share Control,Control that aims to share or distribute the event (or risk) with another context or entity,risk:TransferControl,risk:RiskControl,,,,"Sharing implies a combined responsibility or sharing of effects from an event - which can be between entities or processes (or other contexts). The use of 'event' here broadly refers to any event, which may be a risk event or could also be specific measures being adopted in response to an event. For specifically indicating sharing of risk per typical risk management processes, see risk:ShareRisk",,2025-01-06,,accepted,Harshvardhan J. Pandit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
