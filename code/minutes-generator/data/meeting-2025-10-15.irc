16:17:47 <HarshPandit> Topic: DPV 2.2.1 fixes
20:10:04 <ghurlbot> https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/391 -> Issue 391 [FIX]: Broken links from Consent Schema page to Consent Guide (by coolharsh55)
20:10:04 <ghurlbot> https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/393 -> Issue 393 [FIX]: Links in v2.2 search page are broken (by coolharsh55)
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> HarshPandit: some minor issues with the 2.2 release that should be fixed e.g. broken links in search page, missing info on deprecated concepts, potentially missing OWL files. Propose to fix this and release it as v2.2.1 with tentative date OCT-31
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> \ agreed to release fixes
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> Topic: DPV 2.2 post-release
20:10:04 <ghurlbot> https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/364 -> Issue 364 Submit v2.2 to w3c cg repo for normative purls (by coolharsh55)
20:10:04 <ghurlbot> https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/353 -> Issue 353 v2.2 LOV submission (by coolharsh55)
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> BeatrizEsteves: I will talk with Maria Poveda (LOV maintainer) in December to understand how to better integrate all the extensions in LOV
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> HarshPandit: LOV task moved to v2.3 release given this timeline.
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> HarshPandit: Submission of documents to w3c as formal CG reports will now happen with the v2.2.1 fixes to avoid repeated submissions.
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> Topic: CRDM concepts (EU Publications Office AI Taxonomy)
20:10:04 <ghurlbot> https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/385 -> Issue 385 Align DPV with CRDM AI concepts (by coolharsh55)
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> \ analysis done by Harsh, to be reviewed by Delaram https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H3nSZ6Z4GL5ZdaVKrH2\_oZPc8dsRvNg-MiiosZE-qAOo/edit?gid=1828366854\#gid=1828366854
20:10:04 <ghurlbot> https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/390 -> Issue 390 Adding the taxonomy of AI capablities from EIT report (by DelaramGlp)
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> DelaramGolpayegani: Also relevant for concepts is the analysis of EIT report
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> HarshPandit: let's find concepts which are clearly in scope and are established, then we can sit down and discuss the remaining ones which are not clear
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> Topic: LEGAL DE-GDNG
20:10:04 <ghurlbot> https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/387 -> Issue 387 Extension for the German GDNG (by chhdraeger)
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> \ Julian and Christian are working on this. There are quesions regarding scope as the law references other laws. Suggested to create a core framework and then check which concepts are aligned with those already in DPV. We should focus on providing useful terms/vocabulary rather than legal analysis, so this is fine to be the scope. If the English translation is approximate, then Harsh and Beatriz can also participate.
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> JulianFlake: There are clauses in the law that talks about how other laws should be amended. There are also clauses about medical details etc. so there is discussion on how to handle this in terms of scope. We might come up with a basic set of concepts and then others can suggest to extend these as a baseline.
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> HarshPandit: EDHS is a good way to look at the scope. We just want to model the regulation, and if there are external concepts and they are absolutely necessary then we only model what is in the GDNG law for the moment.
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> Topic: AI Agent
20:10:04 <ghurlbot> https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/197 -> Issue 197 Model `Agent` and `LegalAgent` (by ghurlbot)
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> \ concepts are accepted
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> Topic: Plan for additional concepts from EHDS, AI Act, NIS2
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> \ Discussion regarding the scope of this work, especially regarding what should be considered to be involved. Dedicated meetings will be arranged for this going ahead and the list of topics will focus on the existing scope and applications of DPV.
20:10:04 <ghurlbot> https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/238 -> Issue 238 Update EHDS extension with practical concepts (by coolharsh55)
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> \ Harsh to work on this for reviewing a legal paper
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> \ Beatriz to add concepts by OCT-31
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> \ Harsh will then continue and refine proposal for when Beatriz is back NOV end
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> \ Harsh will loop in Julian for alignment with GDNG
20:10:04 <ghurlbot> https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/222 -> Issue 222 Update NIS2 extension with practical concepts (by coolharsh55)
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> \ Georg has proposed reporting obligaitons, Harsh and Georg will work on this in NOV
20:10:04 <ghurlbot> https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/229 -> Issue 229 Update EU-AIAct extension with practical concepts (by coolharsh55)
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> DelaramGolpayegani: we have key concepts from Art.3 (definitions). For documentation and reporting on incidents, there are new templates from the Commission. It looks like DPV covers that but there isn't an assessment of what is missing.
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> DelaramGolpayegani: There are also other obligations like Risk management, Data Governance, that have overlaps with other requirements like from GDPR.
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> \ Delaram and Harsh to identify a roadmap for concepts to be added from AI Act to DPV; OCT-29 meeting
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> Topic: Proposal from Georg to map ISO/IEC 42005 AI System Impact Assessment
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> BeatrizEsteves: +1 in scope
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> DelaramGolpayegani: +1 in scope, need to decide where the concepts should be included in DPV, e.g. integrated in existing extensions or create a new extension. Having  guide for 42005 can be considered later on.
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> \ agreed this is in scope with the following discussion: If a standard provides useful information, then we add / refine concepts in DPV and extensions with a reference to that standard as the source. We only create an extention when the standard must be specifically represented, such as for certification, or when we are modelling preliminary concepts such as those for IEEE P7012 to support the standard.
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> Topic: Proposal from Beatriz to map EU Unfair Consumer Directive
20:10:04 <ghurlbot> https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/392 -> Issue 392 Extension for the Unfair Contract Terms Directive (by besteves4)
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> \ Discussed this as the Directive providing concepts more focused on consumer protection (contract law), though there are some helpful concepts that could be of relevance to DPV. For example, we have contract as a legal basis, and contractual relations and terms also affect privacy and data protection. Therefore, from a consumer protection perspective, what vocabulary should be provide here? Harsh suggested guidelines for Directive to get examples of these.
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> BeatrizEsteves: goal of this proposal is just to establish if terms connected to personal data protection are in scope of DPV or an extension to DPV. I think most of the work on modelling contractual agreements will be done on an ODRL profile, so the goal is not to have those terms that are not connected to personal data in DPV.
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> HarshPandit: majority of terms on the directive are not directly connected with data protection; only the ones that are related to this should be in scope of DPV - these would include more specific types of notices, contracts, organisational measures, etc. Cristiana Santos also has a recent paper on this directive and its alignment with the DSA, that looks at dark patterns, which should be considered.
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> Topic: AOB
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> Subtopic: IEEE P7012
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> IainHenderson: P7012 is in the final publication phase. People are thinking about deployment and implementation re. Customer Commons. This is with a consortium with stakeholders like MyData, ODI / Solid.
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> \ Discussion on a workshop in November, including DPV extension for supporting this work
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> Subtopic: Documentation
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> \ Delaram and Beatriz pointed out difficulties in the current documentation format. The following was discussed after the meeting in continuation.
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> DelaramGolpayegani: To provide information on how to find and use the extensions, e.g. a Table showing application areas and which extensions are in scope or useful there
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> BeatrizEsteves: Difficult to find where concepts are e.g. a colleague couldn't find all purposes as they are in DPV, in EHDS, and also in SECTOR-HEALTH.
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> Topic: Next Meeting
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> \ The next meeting will be on OCT-22 Wednesday 13:30WEST/14:30CEST
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> \ Agenda for next meeting will be continuing discussion on topics started for v2.3 and any other updates/new proposed topics. The meeting will be chaired by Beatriz Esteves.
