16:17:47 <HarshPandit> HarshPandit: delay in schedule, we are still finalising the concepts and content for EHDS, AI Act, and standards; also the reviews are yet to be made for GDPR, 7012 -- so we will plan to wrap these up today and this week, and have the draft be ready next week

16:17:47 <HarshPandit> HarshPandit: no, but if they want regular contribution and participation then its sensible to have them join the group

16:17:47 <HarshPandit> JulianFlake: could be we make module-wise lists and only expand those as needed for the concept needed
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> HarshPandit: we can have collapsible summary elements but would need extensive testing to make sure it works elsewhere

16:17:47 <HarshPandit> \ discussion on the need for explaining how ISO concepts align with DPV concepts, and approaches being to create extensions so ISO concepts also available in machine-readable format, and to then provide a machine-readable mapping, and a HTML guide for humans; Issues identified regarding copyright, extent of work and coverage, and necessity.
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> HarshPandit: Propose we add core concepts from 29100 to explain foundational ISO concepts like PII and that these are covered in DPV.
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> JulianFlake: can we also add 27000 concepts which are key for security
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> HarshPandit: we can also not provide the extension as the mapping
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> DelaramGolpayegani: +1 for mapping
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> BeatrizEsteves: +1 for mapping

16:17:47 <HarshPandit> Subtopic: ETSI AI standards
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> ArthitSuriyawongkul: two ETSI standards for cybersecurity for cyber resilience act and second is responding to the request for implementing the AI Act in relation to AI operation. They are a bit away from data/privacy and more on cybersecurity/software engineering. May need to see if they are relevant to DPV scope.

16:17:47 <HarshPandit> HarshPandit: To check with folks like Delaram who have worked on AI (Act) standards before would be good to check for scope
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> Subtopic: India's DPDP
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> \ India's DPDP is the privacy law 
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> AjayJadhav: part of the CREDEBL project (https://www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/projects/credebl) in Linux foundation decentralized Trust. We are interested in understanding how DPV can be extended for India's DPDP
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> HarshPandit: Excellent, as we had discussed DPDP before, and Georg/Signatu also had work on this. We have the IN extension for India, so within that namespace we'd have to create an extension for DPDP similar to how EU-GDPR has an extension. Then we model the concepts within that -- we use spreadsheets for this. Best to follow up via email on this.
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> GeorgKrog: We have worked on this as well. Better to combine efforts to avoid duplication/repetition.
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> ACTION: For DPDP, Ajay to email Harsh to follow up the conversation; and then Harsh will loop Georg in for avoiding duplicate work
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> Topic: Next Meeting
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> \ The next meeting will be on FEB-11 Wednesday 13:30WET/14:30CET
