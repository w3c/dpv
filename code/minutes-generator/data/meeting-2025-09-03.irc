16:17:47 <JulianFlake> MarkLizar: There are 7 legal bases in DPV, there should be 6 - which is the 7th one?
16:17:47 <JulianFlake> HarshPandit: there are 8 in DPV based on GDPR Art.6 https://w3c.github.io/dpv/2.2/dpv/#vocab-legal-basis (7 is Art.6 + 1 for data transfers)
16:17:47 <JulianFlake> MarkLizar: There are more meanings of consent, think about medical consent for example
16:17:47 <JulianFlake> HarshPandit: Consent in DPV(core) is a general term and anyone can specify further concepts to describe a specific consent e.g. we extend this to represent GDPR's consent that has additional requirements for validity
16:17:47 <JulianFlake> JulianFlake: Consent in DPV is the consent for processing of (personal) data and not for say medical surgery as that is a different concept
16:17:47 <JulianFlake> MarkLizar: Defining purposes is tricky.
16:17:47 <JulianFlake> JulianFlake: dpv:Purpose can be extended as needed: https://w3c.github.io/dpv/2.1/examples/#E0007
