16:17:47 <HarshPandit> BeatrizEsteves: Beatriz and Julian had a brief meeting this week, went over the proposed concepts for EHDS; also helpful for DE-GDNG mapping
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> BeatrizEsteves: For the high-level concepts, should they go in the healthcare extension because they are mentioned in EHDS and DE-GDNG e.g. Health Data Holder? So this can go in the Healthcare extension and then extend it from there?
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> BeatrizEsteves: Same for more concepts like electronic health data and other concepts
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> JulianFlake: Agree, makes sense also because there isn't a hierarchy between the two laws so this could help have common parent concepts
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> Subtopic: AI Act
20:10:04 <ghurlbot> https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/229 -> Issue 229 Update EU-AIAct extension with practical concepts (by coolharsh55)
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> ACTION: Delaram to prepare two lists for concrete proposal which is straightforward to add as they are based in law; and others which we should review as subjective modelling within DPVCG
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> HarshPandit: meeting with Georg Friday to review the concepts. Once we have consensus, we will polish and propose them for inclusion.

16:17:47 <HarshPandit> Subtopic: GDPR Art.88b
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> HarshPandit: The proposed GDPR Article 88b in omnibus amendement regarding consent manager has importance to DPV in defining purposes and other key information ; will be meeting with the Commission later to discuss this and other relvant aspects; will report back
