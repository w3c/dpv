16:17:47 <HarshPandit> Subtopic: DPVCG Charter
20:10:04 <ghurlbot> https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/399 -> Issue 399 Establish DPVCG Charter (by coolharsh55)
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> \ Vote on approving draft Charter at https://w3id.org/dpv/charter ; discuss on https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/399
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> \ To vote on the charter, please indicate the vote on the github issue https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/399 or you can also indicate this by replying to the email on the public mailing list https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-dpvcg/2025Dec/0002.html
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> Subtopic: Submit to LOV
20:10:04 <ghurlbot> https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/353 -> Issue 353 v2.2 LOV submission (by coolharsh55)
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> BeatrizEsteves: First submission of all extensions needs to be manual every time we do a release, we send an email with a list of the extensions that are updated for them to include the new versions. Check if maintainers can pull the updates automatically. The LOV maintainers are also volunteers, so we cannot ask for too much and we support them as we can
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> ACTION: Beatriz will send email to confirm the procedure with LOV maintainers
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> \ We will update the wiki once confirmed so we have the procedure documented for future versions
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> Topic: Updates
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> Subtopic: ISO taxonomy
20:10:04 <ghurlbot> https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/26 -> Issue 26 DPV-ISO providing concepts from ISO terminology and standards (by coolharsh55)
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> \ To be discussed when Stratis/Georg are here, or to resolve async and update here (Harsh)
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> Subtopic: EHDS
20:10:04 <ghurlbot> https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/238 -> Issue 238 Update EHDS extension with practical concepts (by coolharsh55)
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> HarshPandit: Postponed by Harsh to January. One thing to also discuss in the EHDS meeting is which concepts to put in SECTOR extensions. This means whether to put concepts in DPV, RISK, TECH, etc. or the SECTOR extension for those specifically.
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> BeatrizEsteves: Specifically the purposes should be aligned between DPV and SECTOR. In PACSOI it is not easy to see which concept or extension to use.
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> HarshPandit: Would be helpful to have an "index" e.g. list of purposes across all extensions 
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> BeatrizEsteves: Also the same for personal data categories. Purpose and personal data are the two most important concepts that people start with, so this is what creates most confusion.
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> Subtopic: AI Act
20:10:04 <ghurlbot> https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/229 -> Issue 229 Update EU-AIAct extension with practical concepts (by coolharsh55)
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> HarshPandit: checking AI Act article by article; already reviewed until Article 20 (approx.); changes to risk level concepts and to add specific concepts for AI systems to reflect the obligations on the providers and deployers of these systems.
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> HarshPandit: meeting with Georg Friday to review the concepts. Once we have consensus, we will polish and propose them for inclusion.
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> Subtopic: NIS2
20:10:04 <ghurlbot> https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/222 -> Issue 222 Update NIS2 extension with practical concepts (by coolharsh55)
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> ACTION: Georg, Harsh to discuss NIS2 on incident notifications and assessments asnyc (continued)
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> Subtopic: DE-GDNG
20:10:04 <ghurlbot> https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/387 -> Issue 387 Extension for the German GDNG (by chhdraeger)
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> JulianFlake: We started to map German GDNG law concepts to EHDS concepts. These have German concepts which are aligned with the German version.
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> HarshPandit: if we note the article / clause as source, and use the translated labels to align but not as formal labels, then it should be okay. Did similar work for GDPR, was okay.
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> JulianFlake: An example is the case where the German one has more requirements/different requirements from the EHDS, so this will need discussion. We are developing three models, one for Christian's use-case, one in German for GDNG, and this model also in English to communicate with DPVCG for mapping with EHDS.
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> HarshPandit: Okay, so in January we can continue the GDNG discussion immediately after the EHDS discussions so we make sure both are aligned.
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> JulianFlake: We are meeting next on JAN-12, until then plan to polish the two models and then with Christian for the use-case model.
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> Subtopic: CRDM/EIT AI Concepts
20:10:04 <ghurlbot> https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/385 -> Issue 385 Align DPV with CRDM AI concepts (by coolharsh55)
20:10:04 <ghurlbot> https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/390 -> Issue 390 Adding the taxonomy of AI capablities from EIT report (by DelaramGlp)
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> HarshPandit: Harsh: Unless there are objections we will go ahead with the concepts that we agreed were sensible, and keep the rest as proposed for clarification
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> \ no objections ; accepted
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> Topic: AOB
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> BeatrizEsteves: One of the PhDs in the HARNESS project published a paper on the Data Act in JURIX. Will reach out to them.
16:17:47 <HarshPandit> HarshPandit: Please also CC me for help. We should have a guide or steps with a template spreadsheet for helping people get started.
