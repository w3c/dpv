# DPV Contribution Guide

See [Contribution Guide on the wiki](https://github.com/w3c/dpv/wiki/Contribution-Guide) for guidance on suggesting new terms, raising issues, identifying fixes and solutions, and sending patches or pull requests.

The DPVCG is the primary forum for contributions and participations regarding the DPV. As such, all decisions and resolutions will be conducted through the group's meetings and call. Membership in DPVCG is not necessary to contribute to DPV, but is recommended for participating in the group's decision making process. Contributions and questions can be sent to the group's [public mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-dpvcg/) or expressed as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/dpvcg/dpv/issues).
