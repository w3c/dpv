<h4 id=t02>wiki</h4>
<p id=x015 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> Moved content from w3c wiki to github wiki and set it so that anyone can edit it. Please help maintain. The wiki can be used to share information about guidelines, FAQ, discussions without requiring code changes in repo.</p>
<h4 id=t03>github issues</h4>
<p id=x017 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> There are more (new) issues on github which are not on the agenda, please take a look</p>
<h4 id=t04>github PRs</h4>
<p id=x019 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> Any suggestions or changes needed for how PRs are created and addressed?</p>
<p id=x020 class=bot><cite>&lt;ghurlbot&gt;</cite> <strong><a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/262">Issue 262</a></strong> Refactor documentation generator to be modular (by coolharsh55)</p>
<p id=x021 class=bot><cite>&lt;ghurlbot&gt;</cite> <strong><a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/266">Issue 266</a></strong> Use stable IDs for contributor and webpage BNodes to avoid false git diffs (by coolharsh55)</p>

<p id=x023 class="phone s03"><cite>beatrizEsteves:</cite> make clear to which branch we should submit</p>
<p id=x024 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> That is complicated, unfortunately. Dev branch is where we work on next version, so everything for the next version should go to the dev branch. But if we want to fix something in the published current version, then the master branch contains the code and files for it at that point in time. But in any case, I think dev branch is better as it also contains the versioned outputs (not the same scripts, but we can still do it)</p>
<p id=x025 class="phone s02"><cite>arthitSuriyawongkul:</cite> how to change code directory for previous versions (answer - the code is for the current version of the branch, previous versions are overwritten but are available in git history)</p>

<h3 id=t06>v2.1 maintenance</h3>
<h4 id=t07>broken link</h4>
<p id=x032 class=bot><cite>&lt;ghurlbot&gt;</cite> <strong><a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/269">Issue 269</a></strong> [FIX]: link broken to DPV 2.1 Search Index (by TyttiKatariina)</p>
<p id=x033 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> What should be done for such changes to already published documents? Suggestions?</p>
<p id=x034 class="phone s05"><cite>julianFlake:</cite> how did these happen? will this happen again?</p>
<p id=x035 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> maybe, this happened because the link was hardcoded with the version number (2.1-dev) and when we published it we changed the version number. The solution is to not use version numbers in links directly, but to use the variable in python script which is always set to the correct version so the links also get updated.</p>
<p id=x036 class="phone s05"><cite>julianFlake:</cite> that's okay to do it if its one fix</p>
<p id=x037 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> only place where it won't be fixed is github release zip - but for that we can publish a minor point release e.g. <code>2.1.1</code></p>
<p id=a01 class=action><strong>ACTION:</strong> fix <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/253">#253</a> in live version on github and discuss minor point release</p>

<h3 id=t09>AI Act risk classification</h3>
<p id=x043 class=bot><cite>&lt;ghurlbot&gt;</cite> <strong><a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/231">Issue 231</a></strong> Represent Risk Level classifications for AI/Systems in AI Act (by coolharsh55)</p>
<p id=x044 class="phone s06"><cite>delaramGolpayegani:</cite> proposal with Harsh that we add the categorisations based on whether something is high-risk or prohibited in AI Act using a combination of concepts - for high-risk it is 5 concepts (see this paper &quot;To Be High-Risk, or Not To Be—Semantic Specifications and Implications of the AI Act’s High-Risk AI Applications and Harmonised Standards&quot; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3593013.3594050),">https://<wbr>doi.org/<wbr>10.1145/<wbr>3593013.3594050),</a> for prohibited it is 8 concepts (not published yet). </p>
<p id=x045 class=bot><cite>&lt;ghurlbot&gt;</cite> <strong><a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/183">Issue 183</a></strong> Represent activities where DPIA is required in EU-GDPR (by coolharsh55)</p>
<p id=x046 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> This is also relevant to Tytti's work on DPIA requirements in various jurisdictions - for GDPR</p>
<p id=x047 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> where to publish this? In AI act extension? Benefit is we have everything in one place in the extension - we can put disclaimer and notices in appropriate places in HTML. One issue might be that this is our interpretation and not the information in the act - so we should not put it in the same extension; or that the person using the RDF or data might not see the notice / warning in the HTML</p>
<p id=x048 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> this could be done for e.g. by having a HighRiskCategorisationProcess as a proces and within it the combination e.g. purpose X capability Y and a hasRiskLevel ai-act:HighRisk and then this is the 'template' to use for detecting if something is high risk or not</p>
<p id=x049 class="phone s06"><cite>delaramGolpayegani:</cite> would be good idea to have it in the same extension </p>
<p id=x050 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> we could have examples to see how this looks and discuss it further</p>
<p id=x051 class="phone s07"><cite>paulRyan:</cite> +1 to discuss with examples</p>
<p id=x052 class="phone s03"><cite>beatrizEsteves:</cite> +1</p>

<h3 id=t10>Stratis' Thesis</h3>
<p id=x055 class=bot><cite>&lt;ghurlbot&gt;</cite> <strong><a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/278">Issue 278</a></strong> [NEW]: Misc concepts based on GDPR CoC and Certifications (by coolharsh55)</p>
<p id=x056 class=summary> presentation slides &quot;The Importance of Expressing GDPR Codes of Conduct and Certificates in Machine Readable Format&quot; <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-dpvcg/2025Mar/0005.html">https://<wbr>lists.w3.org/<wbr>Archives/<wbr>Public/<wbr>public-dpvcg/<wbr>2025Mar/<wbr>0005.html</a></p>
<p id=x057 class="phone s04"><cite>stratisKoulierakis:</cite> DPV should incorporate and be aligned with Codes of Conduct (CoC) and certifications under GDPR as these contain specific terminologies which are legally relevant. Proposal from my thesis. This can be done by incorporating the concepts and creating like a profile of DPV or providing guidance on how to create profiles of DPV for specific use-cases.</p>
<p id=x058 class="phone s04"><cite>stratisKoulierakis:</cite> Examples: class Organisation - extend with Credit reporting agency, Private education institution; Purposes - grid management (with further examples in grid management CoC), meter management (with further examples in meter management CoC); Technical measures - Age check practices, Zoning, Email deletion; Organisational measures - Flagging AI outputs, Video monitoring, Personnel screening</p>
<p id=x059 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> language is sometimes not consistent</p>
<p id=x060 class="phone s04"><cite>stratisKoulierakis:</cite> indeed, language can change - and we should remember that these language are from multiple languages or can be translated from these languages, so we should focus on the concept itself </p>
<p id=x061 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> what do you suggest by profiles? We have started adding an alignment table listing concepts in law and saying which are compatible concepts in DPV - is this is the same?</p>
<p id=x062 class="phone s04"><cite>stratisKoulierakis:</cite> ODRL for example has Market Data profile - so I'm wondering if something similar can exist for DPV, would be happy to contribute to that</p>
<p id=x063 class="phone s02"><cite>arthitSuriyawongkul:</cite> The energy sector examples can be relevant to Cyber Resilience Act. Smart meter is probably a Class II device in CRA (chat)</p>
<p id=x064 class="phone s07"><cite>paulRyan:</cite> Find the CoC and specifications area to be interesting as this is related to my work (on ROPA specifications) as it enables covering the CoC or certification which is a very manual process and this can be an opportunity for automation</p>
<p id=x065 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> should think about how to best do this and then do it</p>
<p id=x066 class="phone s03"><cite>beatrizEsteves:</cite> we can take CoC as an example of what we want to support with DPV-ODRL mapping</p>
<p id=x067 class="phone s07"><cite>paulRyan:</cite> merit in Art.42 certification as this is massively a manual effort at the moment (for GDPR)</p>
<p id=x068 class="phone s06"><cite>delaramGolpayegani:</cite> CoC for AI being developed for AI Act, with certifications and presumption of conformity </p>
