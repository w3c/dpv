<h3 id=t02>Reuse Compatibility for Regulations</h3>
<p id=x018 class=bot><cite>&lt;ghurlbot&gt;</cite> <strong><a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/298">Issue 298</a></strong> Model Purpose Compatibility statuses for GDPR (by coolharsh55)</p>
<p id=x019 class=bot><cite>&lt;ghurlbot&gt;</cite> <strong><a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/300">Issue 300</a></strong> Model Intended Purpose Compatibility statuses for AI Act (by coolharsh55)</p>
<p id=x020 class=bot><cite>&lt;ghurlbot&gt;</cite> <strong><a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/299">Issue 299</a></strong> Model Purpose Compatibility statuses for EHDS (by coolharsh55)</p>
<p id=x021 class="phone s02"><cite>HarshPandit:</cite> for context, we are adding <code>dpv:ReuseCompatibility</code> as statuses in v2.2, which allows specifying whether something has primary or secondary compatibility where the test of compatibility is not specified by us. These concepts are also useful in legal contexts, and we have discussed before that we should describe these legal notions should be described with DPV concepts. </p>
<p id=x022 class="phone s02"><cite>HarshPandit:</cite> For GDPR, this is purpose compatibility; for AI Act this is Intended Purpose compatibility, and for the EHDS this is based on Secondary Uses defined in the law. GDPR has case law and guidelines to utilise, and EHDS has a legal list of cases. For the AI Act we might need what ends up becoming original research here.</p>
<p id=x023 class="phone s03"><cite>DelaramGolpayegani:</cite> For AI Act, we can have different types of compatibility, e.g. <code>IntendedPurpose</code> is a subclass of the Provider's <code>IntendedPurpose</code> then it is is compatible, but superclass means it is not necessarily compatible</p>
<p id=x024 class="phone s02"><cite>HarshPandit:</cite> we also need to identify the elements of intended purpose based on which we decide if its a subclass or not</p>
<p id=x025 class="phone s03"><cite>DelaramGolpayegani:</cite> we should think of different scenarios and cases for compatibility. We should look at the guidelines for prohibited systems and GenAI which could be a helpful resource as they provide info on intended purpose and downstream providers</p>
<p id=x032 class="phone s02"><cite>HarshPandit:</cite> The definition of the intended purpose in the AI Act Art.3(12) has several components and sources, <br>
<span id=x033>… 1) context -- what info is included here?</span><br>
<span id=x034>… 2) conditions of use -- likewise, what info?</span><br>
<span id=x035>… 3) instructions for use -- we can assume this is as per documentation in the AI Act?</span><br>
<span id=x036>… 4) promotional or sales materials and statements -- does this mean the deployer now has to keep track of promotions and marketing by the provider to ensure the intended purpose is compatible?</span><br>
<span id=x037>… 5) technical documentation -- also can assume this is from the AI Act?</span><br>
<span id=x038>… So based on these, we have at least 3 levels of information -- from  documentation in the AI Act, from other obligations for context, and from external sources like marketing.</span></p>
<p id=x039 class="phone s03"><cite>DelaramGolpayegani:</cite> This means <code>IntendedPurpose</code> is a compound concept (will contain other concepts in it). We can start with a baseline using the 5 concept framework <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3593013.3594050">https://<wbr>doi.org/<wbr>10.1145/<wbr>3593013.3594050</a> To Be High-Risk, or Not To Be—Semantic Specifications and Implications of the AI Act’s High-Risk AI Applications and Harmonised Standards </p>
<p id=x040 class="phone s02"><cite>HarshPandit:</cite> So next steps here are to discuss this further in other meetings, and then report back findings or proposals to the group to make decisions on. Going ahead we will use this format i.e. dedicated meetings/sessions for specific topics, and then using this weekly meeting to share it with wider group and for making decisions.</p>

<h3 id=t03>AI Agents</h3>
<p id=x042 class=bot><cite>&lt;ghurlbot&gt;</cite> <strong><a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/197">Issue 197</a></strong> Model `Agent` and `LegalAgent` (by ghurlbot)</p>
<p id=x043 class="phone s02"><cite>HarshPandit:</cite> We have discussed the notion of <code>Agent</code> in prior meetings and our concern on how to distinguish this from the legal notion of agent. Now that we have the AI extension, should we model <code>ai:Agent</code> as an AI specific concept?</p>
<p id=x044 class="phone s04"><cite>JulianFlake:</cite> do we have a broad concept existing in DPV that this will be based on? (answer: yes, as <code>dpv:Entity</code>, and we have also discussed distinction between <code>MachineAgent</code> and <code>LegalAgent</code>)</p>
<p id=x045 class="phone s04"><cite>JulianFlake:</cite> raises broader question of whether the agent should have copyright etc. E.g. if the agent does something who is responsible</p>
<p id=x046 class="phone s02"><cite>HarshPandit:</cite> this is also a topic of contention and discussion in legal circles and it is difficult to have an answer as legally this will require changing the laws themselves to either give or prohibit assigning rights to agents. This is outside the scope of DPVCG.</p>
<p id=x047 class="phone s01"><cite>IngeVejsbjerg:</cite> Colleagues in US are working on a attribution statement <a href="https://aiattribution.github.io/">https://<wbr>aiattribution.github.io/</a> </p>
<p id=x048 class="phone s02"><cite>HarshPandit:</cite> Art has also been mentioning interesting work on this topic in the issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/82">w3c/<wbr>dpv#82</a> which includes a vocabulary for AI training by Creative Commons e.g. what should be done when training; and an effort by IETF to mention AI training in the robots.txt format</p>
<p id=x049 class="phone s03"><cite>DelaramGolpayegani:</cite> where are you getting the definition of Agent from?</p>
<p id=x050 class="phone s02"><cite>HarshPandit:</cite> We should should look for well-cited definitions from literature</p>
<p id=x051 class="phone s01"><cite>IngeVejsbjerg:</cite> Agent refers to system/program that can autonomously perform tasks for the user</p>
<p id=x052 class="phone s02"><cite>HarshPandit:</cite> how do we distinguish this from software in general?</p>
<p id=x053 class="phone s01"><cite>IngeVejsbjerg:</cite> AI Agent will be an AI system </p>
<p id=x054 class="phone s03"><cite>DelaramGolpayegani:</cite> ISO 22989 has a definition: 3.1.1 AI agent - automated (3.1.7) entity that senses and responds to its environment and takes actions to achieve its goals</p>
<p id=x055 class="phone s02"><cite>HarshPandit:</cite> I think its been discussed to be amended or whether this is sufficient e.g. what does &quot;sense&quot; and &quot;respond&quot; mean, but let's start with that and see if it fits e.g. Inge's definition and other tasks</p>

<h3 id=t04>AOB</h3>
<p id=x057 class=summary> topic mention in chat</p>
<p id=x058 class="phone s05"><cite>MarkLizar:</cite> we have work called differential transparency - where a notice receipt is compared against each other to see if there is a difference in active state of a privacy in a session,  in terns of purpose, the permissions for access, control and use for that purpose can also be compared so that a visual indicator for risk can be displayed real-time. i am interesed if i can be looped into the conversation</p>
<p id=x059 class=summary> note after the meeting: the above seems to be in scope of the reuse compatibility concept, where the test for compatibility can be extended outside the DPVCG for Mark's purposes i.e. the use-case can use their own criteria and create concepts for whether something is comaptible (primary use) or not (secondary use).</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t05>Next Meeting</h3>
<p id=x061 class=summary> The next meeting will be on JUL-30 Thursday 13:30WEST/14:30CEST (new time slot) </p>
<p id=x062 class=summary> Agenda will be reviewing DPV v2.2 draft release, deciding on weekly meeting slot, and starting work on v2.3 -- with a preference to identify topics for discussion where materials/arguments exist and so that we can revist what needs to be done for them.</p>
