<h3 id=t01>v2.2</h3>
<p id=x015 class=summary> milestone <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/milestone/7">https://<wbr>github.com/<wbr>w3c/<wbr>dpv/<wbr>milestone/<wbr>7</a> -- new issues</p>
<h4 id=t02>changelog</h4>
<p id=x017 class="phone s01"><cite>HarshPandit:</cite> full changelog draft <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/blob/changelog-2.2/2.2/changelog.html">https://<wbr>github.com/<wbr>w3c/<wbr>dpv/<wbr>blob/<wbr>changelog-2.2/<wbr>2.2/<wbr>changelog.html</a> to be updated with RISK (see next)</p>
<h4 id=t03>RISK: Lose vs Loss</h4>
<p id=x019 class=bot><cite>&lt;ghurlbot&gt;</cite> <strong><a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/368">Issue 368</a></strong> [FIX]: Typo on Reputational Risks concepts codes starting with Lose (by csarven)</p>
<p id=x020 class="phone s01"><cite>HarshPandit:</cite> Last meeting we agreed on using core Noun + &quot;Loss&quot; prefix e.g. CredibilityLoss and ReputationLoss. </p>
<p id=x021 class="phone s02"><cite>GeorgKrog:</cite> Should be <code>ReputationalLoss</code></p>
<p id=x022 class="phone s03"><cite>PaulRyan:</cite> Agreed</p>
<p id=x023 class="phone s02"><cite>GeorgKrog:</cite> There is Damage or Harm and then you have to prove that a Damage has led to Loss, and action that caused Damage has a causal link to the Loss (this differs across Jurisdictions)</p>
<p id=x024 class=summary> agreed to continue with v2.2</p>
<p id=a01 class=action><strong>ACTION:</strong> Change RISK concept to <code>ReputationalLoss</code></p>
<h4 id=t04>Damage/Harms taxonomy</h4>
<p id=x027 class="phone s02"><cite>GeorgKrog:</cite> We should try to build a better taxonomy for damages e.g. Discrimination can be damage</p>
<p id=x028 class="phone s01"><cite>HarshPandit:</cite> But that's more of a sometimes type relation because discrimation leads to something like loss of opportunity or psychological impact which you then show in court as damage</p>
<p id=x029 class="phone s02"><cite>GeorgKrog:</cite> <a href="https://ico.org.uk/media2/about-the-ico/documents/4020144/overview-of-data-protection-harms-and-the-ico-taxonomy-v1-202204.pdf">https://<wbr>ico.org.uk/<wbr>media2/<wbr>about-the-ico/<wbr>documents/<wbr>4020144/<wbr>overview-of-data-protection-harms-and-the-ico-taxonomy-v1-202204.pdf</a> Harms taxonomy by ICO</p>
<p id=x030 class="phone s01"><cite>HarshPandit:</cite> Even though ICO calls this a &quot;harms taxonomy&quot;, not all of these are harms</p>
<p id=x031 class="phone s02"><cite>GeorgKrog:</cite> How will practioners understand how to use the DPV taxonomy?</p>
<p id=x032 class="phone s01"><cite>HarshPandit:</cite> We need a guide for general Risk assessment and then additionally how to use this in the guides for DBIA and DPIA</p>
<p id=x033 class="phone s02"><cite>GeorgKrog:</cite> We don't have much support for liability. We have rights taxonomy and liability from rights breaches, but we need other liability beyond contract ... </p>
<p id=x034 class="phone s02"><cite>GeorgKrog:</cite> Why should DPV help formulate that because an action led to an event, you experiened some kind of consequence. Then you need to write a letter to the organsiation claiming how you suffered damages.</p>
<p id=x035 class="phone s01"><cite>HarshPandit:</cite> This can be done two ways - 1) you simply tell the controller what happend (with DPV concepts) or 2) you ask your lawyer to send a legally written letter asserting damages where you write about legal frameworks and what is the threshold that has been reached -- which is the same as you would in courts. </p>
<p id=x036 class="phone s04"><cite>MarkLizar:</cite> We have been looking for ways to have the users pass on liability back to the organisation (paraphrased). This goes beyond the bounds of data protection.</p>
<h4 id=t05>Beta Release</h4>
<p id=x038 class=summary> agree to publish as beta release with time period until SEP-15</p>
<p id=x039 class=summary> Beta release will be published whenever the current round of fixes and changelog are completed</p>

<h3 id=t06>AI Agents</h3>
<p id=x041 class=bot><cite>&lt;ghurlbot&gt;</cite> <strong><a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/197">Issue 197</a></strong> Model `Agent` and `LegalAgent` (by ghurlbot)</p>
<p id=x042 class="phone s01"><cite>HarshPandit:</cite> propose we add the concepts so there is a vocabulary to use, and later we can finalise the definitions and relationships as we get normative/authoritative sources. We will have working definitions, but we are mostly allowing people to represent that they are doing something or using this concept (AI Agent). We will add a note to this effect.</p>

<p id=a02 class=action><strong>ACTION:</strong> Add AI Agent concepts as discussed</p>

<h3 id=t07>AI Model Development Phases</h3>
<p id=x047 class=bot><cite>&lt;ghurlbot&gt;</cite> <strong><a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/294">Issue 294</a></strong> AI Model Development Phases (by coolharsh55)</p>
<p id=x048 class="phone s01"><cite>HarshPandit:</cite> Last time we discussed taking lifecycle concepts from 5338 which are already in DPV and then creating phases aligned with that </p>
<p id=x049 class="phone s05"><cite>DelaramGolpayegani:</cite> In VAIR the concepts came from 22989</p>
<p id=a03 class=action><strong>ACTION:</strong> Delaram to look at ISO 5338 and 22989 to develop lifecycle stages/phases concepts</p>
<p id=x051 class="phone s01"><cite>HarshPandit:</cite> We want to have coverage in terms of the concepts like we did for Training which became a processing operation and then there can be a TrainingProcess where this is involved, some input data, and the output is a trained model.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t08>Locations</h3>
<p id=x053 class=bot><cite>&lt;ghurlbot&gt;</cite> <strong><a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/341">Issue 341</a></strong> Add Location concepts to PD extension e.g. Home, Work (by coolharsh55)</p>
<p id=x054 class=bot><cite>&lt;ghurlbot&gt;</cite> <strong><a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/342">Issue 342</a></strong> Add Location concepts to TECH extension e.g. Device, App (by coolharsh55)</p>
<p id=x055 class="phone s01"><cite>HarshPandit:</cite> We have location concepts that are personal data, so they go in PD extension. We have locations that can be used to store data e.g. devices, so they go in TECH extension. However, we also discussed other locations which are needed to represent things such as train stations and airports where e.g. a CCTV is deployed. Even if this location is the person's location i.e. the person is at the airport, the concept cannot be modelled as personal data directly always.</p>
<p id=x056 class="phone s01"><cite>HarshPandit:</cite> options 1) namespace within Location e.g. <code>/loc/xyz</code> or 2) we don't provide this in DPV</p>
<p id=x057 class="phone s02"><cite>GeorgKrog:</cite> What could be the use-case for this?</p>
<p id=x058 class="phone s01"><cite>HarshPandit:</cite> E.g. you go to the airport and there are cameras there, how do you describe the location airport or a school where the camera is? Its a different concept to state the person was at the airport (person's location) from the airport as a location. So a taxonomy of such places would be helpful -- these are directly relevant to represent DPIA necessary activities and high risk AI system deployments.</p>
<p id=x059 class="phone s04"><cite>MarkLizar:</cite> Take a picture of the camera sign to show where is ther camera.</p>
<p id=x060 class=summary> discussion to be continued next time</p>

<h3 id=t09>Next Meeting</h3>
<p id=x062 class=summary> The next meeting will be on AUG-27 Thursday 13:30WEST/14:30CEST</p>
<p id=x063 class=summary> Agenda will be finalising DPV v2.2 beta release, and starting work on v2.3 -- with a preference to identify topics for discussion where materials/arguments exist and so that we can revist what needs to be done for them. </p>
<h4 id=t10>Calendar link for meetings</h4>
<p id=x065 class="phone s02"><cite>GeorgKrog:</cite> issues finding calendar meeting link</p>

<p id=a05 class=action><strong>ACTION:</strong> Harsh will send email to ask if there are other issues / affected people</p>
