    dct:description """<p>This example highlights the implications of using DPV with RDFS+SKOS and OWL semantics. The RDFS+SKOS model is suitable for when DPV concepts have to be used 'directly' e.g. an use-case wants to use 'Encryption' from DPV as a technical measure without creating a specific 'instance' representing their implementation of the encryption. RDFS+SKOS model is also suitable for when an use-case wants to further create an hierarchical taxonomy of the different 'Encryption' concepts they are using. Such use of DPV concepts covers both T-box and A-box, and does not restrict or require the underlying ontology/schema to be constantly changed as new concepts are identified in an use-case.</p>
      <p>In comparison, the OWL2 model defines concepts as classes and instances with a clear separation between the two i.e. the Tbox and Abox are separate. This means the concept 'Encryption' cannot be directly used with OWL2 semantics and an instance of it must first be created. If instead DPV had provided 'Encryption' as an instance (of Technical Measure) then the further expansion and creation of a hierarchy of encryption concepts described earlier is not feasible in OWL2 as it results in a complex graph which is not efficient for reasoning. Further, making changes such as promoting 'Encryption' from instance to class requires changing the ontology/schema - which may not always be possible or feasible in use-cases.</p>
      <p>Thus, the relative strengths and weaknesses of RDFS+SKOS and OWL2 serialisations dictate which should be used. RDFS+SKOS is 'lightweight' and better if the use-case only requires rudimentary or simple reasoning. OWL2 is  better suited for semantic reasoners that can perform complex discovery and validation processes but require more strict and restricted use of concepts. By providing both serialisations, DPV enables the adopters to choose the most suitable serialisation that supports their use-case and/or existing implementations, and retains semantic interoperability based on converting between SKOS and OWL2 (see <a href="https://www.w3.org/2006/07/SWD/SKOS/skos-and-owl/master.html">Using OWL and SKOS (2008)</a>).</p>""" ;

Method 2 shows a processing instance which is implemented using a specific technology. This is acceptable as it describes the processing operation in terms of involved technology, and can be a way to reuse the processing operation in other processes while someone (e.g. IT department) can change the underlying technology. Method 3 represents the best practice of using dpv:Process to describe all concepts in a modular and granular manner with a separation of concerns. Processes can include other processes - so we can describe processing and technology and data involved as a process and involve it in other processes. This makes the task of finding information easier as we only have to look for composition of processes, instead of investigating each purpose or processing or another concept involved for what data or technology it involves.</p>""" ;

    dct:description """<p>This example shows how risk controls can be used to represent the specific measures in place to detect, monitor, address, and inform stakeholders regarding risks, consequences, and impacts. The first part shows a risk with its associated consequence and resulting impact. The second part shows the process where this risk is present, and the specific controls put in place to: (1) monitor the process for vulnerabilities and avoid the source of risk with oversight,; (2) avoid the consequence event; and (3) monitor for occurence of the impact event, and if it occurs to halt it and to inform the affected person.</p>
<p>In this example the specific details of the control such as the technology being used, or what characteristics are changed when avoiding an event are not specified to reduce the length of content. To express this information, the specific control can reference two events as Risk and Residual Risk respectively - one which shows the initial values such as likelihood, and another one which shows the modified values. Currently the DPVCG does not dictate a specific method for expressing such information, and welcomes suggestions on best practices for the same.</p>""" ;

    dct:description """<p>This example shows how the same concept <code>risk:DataBreach</code> can take on different roles across contexts. The first part shows data breach as a consequence of a malware attack, while the second part shows it as a risk source which could lead to identity fraud and misuse. In these, the same concept of data breach being a consequence or a risk source is context-dependant. The RISK extension does not specify or assert that a data breach is always a risk source or risk or consequence - only that it has the potential to be these things. Therefore, inclusion of RISK extension in the graph does not 'pollute' it or cause misinterpretations such as data breach showing up as a consequence even though it has been asserted to (only) be a risk source.</p>
<p>The third part shows how these different roles are associated with the concept, and how this can be used in UI/UX to provide users with a list of options for selecting risks. It also shows the distinction between marking or annotating a concept to include it in risk identification process (<code>risk:PotentialRisk</code>) and asserting that the concept is applicable as a risk in a process (<code>dpv:hasRisk</code>). This allows use-cases to directly use the RISK extension's subjective classification of concepts in UI/UX - such as to populate the dropdown of risks, and also provides flexibility to ignore that and create their own thesauri or categorisations by using the <code>risk:PotentialRisk</code> concept to annotate concepts, or to create specific subclasses for contextual classifications.</p>""" ;

In this example, a customer of a company has complained that their GDPR rights have been violated. Upon investigation, it was found that the GDPR's Transparency Right (Article 13) was impacted by limiting the scope of the right as not all processing was represented, and further the right was obstructed as it was not easy to obtain the information on the website." ;
