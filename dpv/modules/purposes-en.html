    <figcaption>Overview of Purpose taxonomy in DPV (click to open in new window)</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>DPV’s taxonomy of purposes is used to represent the reason or justification for processing of personal data. For this, purposes are organised within DPV based on how they relate to the processing of personal data in terms of several factors, such as: management functions related to information (e.g. records, account, finance), fulfilment of objectives (e.g. delivery of goods), providing goods and services (e.g. service provision), intended benefits (e.g. optimisations for service provider or consumer), and legal compliance.</p>

  <p>DPV provides a taxonomy of Purpose <i>instances</i> for use with [=hasPurpose=] relation. In addition, DPV also defines the concept [=Sector=] (associated using [=hasSector=]) to indicate a contextual interpretation of the purpose within a specified sector.</p>
