The mission of the W3C Data Privacy Vocabularies and Controls CG (DPVCG) is to develop a taxonomy of privacy and data protection related terms, which include in particular terms from the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), such as a taxonomy of personal data as well as a classification of purposes (i.e., purposes for data collection), and events of disclosures, consent, and processing such personal data.

## Specifications

Newcomers to the DPV are recommended to start with the [Primer](https://w3id.org/dpv/primer) to familiarise themselves with the concepts, semantics, and usefulness of the DPV. A [Concise Primer](https://w3id.org/dpv/primer/concise) is also available for a quick (2-pager) introduction to DPV.

### Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV)

The [Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV)](https://w3id.org/dpv) provides an ontology (classes and properties) along with taxonomies that represent real-world uses of these concepts for representing information regarding how (personal) data and technologies (including AI). For example, it provides concepts and taxonomies to represent:

- purposes of processing data or using technologies
- personal data categories
- processing operations on data
- technical and organisational measures for safeguarding data and processes
- legal basis used to indicate why it is legally permitted
- rights involved and how to exercise them
- risks applicable and what would be its consequences and impacts

> The versionless base IRI, e.g. `https://w3id.org/dpv`, always points to the latest release which is a versioned IRI, e.g. `https://w3id.org/dpv/2.2` for v2.2.

The namespace for DPV terms is `http://w3id.org/dpv#` with suggested prefix `dpv`, and serialisations are provided in RDF/XML, Turtle, JSON-LD, and N3 formats. The default serialisations are defined using RDFS/SKOS semantics, with an [alternate serialisation](https://w3id.org/dpv/dpv-owl) defined using OWL2 semantics.

### Extensions

These extensions provide additional concepts that extend the concepts and scope of the main DPV specification:

- [Personal Data (PD)](https://w3id.org/dpv/pd) provides a taxonomy of personal data categories;
- [Location (LOC)](https://w3id.org/dpv/loc) provides a taxonomy of location concepts based on ISO 3166 (countries, regions);
- [Technology (TECH)](https://w3id.org/dpv/tech) provides a taxonomy of technology concepts;
- [AI](https://w3id.org/dpv/ai) provides a taxonomy of AI concepts extending the TECH extension;
- [Justifications](https://w3id.org/dpv/justifications) provides concepts for representing justifications i.e. why something must be done or could not be done;
- [Risk](https://w3id.org/dpv/risk) provides concepts for risk assessment and management;

In v2.1, the Sector and Standard group of extensions was added to the DPV specifications. [Sector](https://w3id.org/dpv/sector) provides sector-specific concepts which extend concepts in other DPV extensions. Currently, the following sectors are represented:

- [SECTOR-EDUCATION](https://w3id.org/dpv/sector/education) for Education Sector
- [SECTOR-FINANCE](https://w3id.org/dpv/sector/finance) for Finance Sector
- [SECTOR-HEALTH](https://w3id.org/dpv/sector/health) for Health Sector
- [SECTOR-INFRA](https://w3id.org/dpv/sector/infra) for (Critical) Infrastructure Sector
- [SECTOR-LAW](https://w3id.org/dpv/sector/law) for Law Enforcement & Justice Sector
- [SECTOR-PUBLICSERVICES](https://w3id.org/dpv/sector/publicservices) for Public Services Sector

The Standards extensions are aimed to provide additional concepts for implementing specific standards using DPV. Currently it contains [IEEE-P7012](https://w3id.org/dpv/standards/p7012) based on [IEEE P7012 Draft Standard for Machine Readable Personal Privacy Terms](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/7012/7192/).

### Extensions for Jurisdictions and Regulations

The LEGAL extensions provide concepts associated with specific jurisdictions and the laws, authorities, and treaties within them. The [Legal](https://w3id.org/dpv/legal) page provides an overview of these. The jurisdictions are represented by using their ISO 3166-2 codes.

### Other Resources

The NACE Taxonomy serialised in RDFS (previously available at <https://w3id.org/dpv/dpv-nace>) provided a serialisation of the NACE v2 taxonomy in RDFS for use with DPV terms. Since then, [NACE v2.1](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/nace) has been published by the EU Commission. The DPVCG has decided to retire/not provide an alternative serialisation of NACE as it provided no significant benefit and the best practice for using NACE is to always utilise the official authoritative version.
