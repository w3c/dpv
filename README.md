> **Announcement: DPV 2.0 Release**
>
> ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/DPV-version%202.0-green?labelColor=black) The scope of DPV has been expanded to include non-personal data and AI technologies - though the focus of the group remains on privacy and data protection. The structure of the repo has also been changed to incorporate multiple jurisdictions and regulations, and their names have been changed e.g. `dpv-gdpr` is `legal/eu/gdpr`. The article [Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV) -- Version 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13426) by Pandit et al. (2024), accepted for presentation at the 23rd International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC 2024), describes DPV v2 in terms of its contents, methodology, current adoptions and uses, and future potential. It also describes the relevance and role of DPV in acting as a common vocabulary to support various regulatory (e.g. EU's DGA and AI Act) and community initiatives (e.g. Solid) emerging across the globe. A [Search Index](https://w3id.org/dpv/2.0/search) of all concepts from DPV and extensions is available.

> ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/DPV-version%201.0-red?labelColor=black) is available under a new versioned IRI for continued use - though the DPVCG recommends using the latest version of DPV. Versioned IRIs have been created to refer to specific versions, with https://w3id.org/dpv/1.0 for v1 and https://w3id.org/dpv/2.0 for v2. The versionless IRI https://w3id.org/dpv will always point to the latest version. See the [v2 changelog](https://w3id.org/dpv/2.0/changelog) for more details. 

The mission of the W3C Data Privacy Vocabularies and Controls CG (DPVCG) is to develop a taxonomy of privacy and data protection related terms, which include in particular terms from the new European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), such as a taxonomy of personal data as well as a classification of purposes (i.e., purposes for data collection), and events of disclosures, consent, and processing such personal data.

## Specifications
Newcomers to the DPV are recommended to start with the [Primer](https://w3id.org/dpv/primer) to familiarise themselves with the concepts, semantics, and usefulness of the DPV. A [Concise Primer](https://w3id.org/dpv/primer) is also available for a quick (2-pager) introduction to DPV.
### Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV)
The [Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV)](https://w3id.org/dpv) provides an ontology (classes and properties) and taxonomies of concepts to represent information regarding how personal data is processed in the form of an ontology or a knowledge graph. For example, it provides taxonomies associated with:

* purposes of processing
* personal data categories involved
* processing operations
* technical and organisational measures or restrictions applied
* legal basis used to justify processing
* information about legal basis for processing
* rights as applicable
* risks as applicable

The namespace for DPV terms is `http://w3id.org/dpv#` with suggested prefix `dpv`, and serialisations are provided in RDF/XML, Turtle, JSON-LD, and N3 formats. The default serialisations are defined using RDFS/SKOS semantics, with an [alternate serialisation](https://w3id.org/dpv/dpv-owl) defined using OWL2 semantics.

### Extensions
These extensions provide additional concepts that extend the concepts and scope of the main DPV specification:
- [Personal Data (PD)](https://w3id.org/dpv/pd) provides a taxonomy of personal data categories
- [Location (LOC)](https://w3id.org/dpv/loc) provides a taxonomy of location concepts based on ISO 3166 (countries, regions)
- [Technology (TECH)](https://w3id.org/dpv/tech) provides a taxonomy of technology concepts
- [AI](https://w3id.org/dpv/ai) provides a taxonomy of AI concepts extending the TECH extension
- [Justifications](https://w3id.org/dpv/justifications) provides concepts for representing justifications i.e. why something must be done or could not be done
- [Risk](https://w3id.org/dpv/risk) provides concepts for risk assessment and management

### Extensions for Jurisdictions and Regulations
The legal extensions provide concepts associated with specific jurisdictions and the laws, authorities, and treaties within them. The [Legal](https://w3id.org/dpv/legal) page provides an overview of these. The jurisdictions are represented by using their ISO 3166-2 codes.

- [European Union (EU)](https://w3id.org/dpv/legal/eu)
    - [GDPR](https://w3id.org/dpv/legal/eu/gdpr)
    - [DGA](https://w3id.org/dpv/legal/eu/dga)
    - [AI Act](https://w3id.org/dpv/legal/eu/aiact)
    - [Charter of Fundamental Rights](https://w3id.org/dpv/legal/eu/rights)
- [Germany (DE)](https://w3id.org/dpv/legal/de)
- [Ireland (IE)](https://w3id.org/dpv/legal/ie)
- [India (IN)](https://w3id.org/dpv/legal/in)
- [United Kingdom (GB)](https://w3id.org/dpv/legal/gb)
- [United States of America (USA)](https://w3id.org/dpv/legal/usa)

### Other Resources
The [NACE Taxonomy serialised in RDFS](https://w3id.org/dpv/dpv-nace) provides a serialisation of the NACE v2 taxonomy in RDFS for use with DPV terms. Since then, NACE v2.1 has been published by the EU Commission. The DPVCG has decided to retire/not provide an alternative serialisation of NACE as it provided no significant benefit and the best practice for using NACE is to always utilise the official authoritative version.

## Guides
