"AnonymisedData","Anonymised Data","Personal Data that has been (fully and completely) anonymised so that it is no longer considered Personal Data","dpv:NonPersonalData","sc","","","","It is advised to carefully consider indicating data is fully or completely anonymised by determining whether the data by itself or in combination with other data can identify a person. Failing this condition, the data should be denoted as PseudoAnonymisedData. To indicate data is anonymised only for a specified entity (e.g. within an organisation), the concept AnonymisedDataWithinScope (as subclass of PseudoAnonymisedData) should be used instead of AnonymisedData.","","2022-01-19","","accepted","Piero Bonatti","https://www.w3.org/community/dpvcg/wiki/MinutesOfMeeting_20220119","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Transfer of this data outside of the context should consider that it is not anonymised, but is pseudo-anonymised data.","","","","proposed","Harshvardhan J.

For GDPR, Special categories of personal data are considered a subset of sensitive data.

As a probable rule, sensitive data require additional considerations whereas special category data requires additional legal basis / justifications.","","2022-01-19","","accepted","Harshvardhan J.
